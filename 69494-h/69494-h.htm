  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>‘<em>Mrs. Hungerford has well deserved the title of being one of the most
fascinating novelists of the day. The stories written by her are the airiest,
lightest, and brightest imaginable, full of wit, spirit, and gaiety; but they contain,
nevertheless, touches of the most exquisite pathos. There is something
good in all of them.</em>’—<span class='sc'>Academy.</span></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MAIDEN ALL FORLORN</strong>, and other Stories. Post
8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, <strong>2s.&#160;6d.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is no guile in the novels of the authoress of “Molly Bawn,” nor any
consistency or analysis of character; but they exhibit a faculty truly remarkable
for reproducing the rapid small-talk, the shallow but harmless “chaff” of certain
strata of modern fashionable society.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>IN DURANCE VILE</strong>, and other Stories. Post 8vo.,
illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, <strong>2s.&#160;6d.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford’s Irish girls have always been pleasant to meet upon the
dusty pathways of fiction. They are flippant, no doubt, and often sentimental,
and they certainly flirt, and their stories are told often in rather ornamental
phrase and with a profusion of the first person singular. But they are charming
all the same.’—<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MENTAL STRUGGLE.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards,
2s.; cloth limp, <strong>2s.&#160;6d.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>‘She can invent an interesting story, she can tell it well, and she trusts to
honest, natural, human emotions and interests of life for her materials.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MODERN CIRCE.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.;
cloth limp, <strong>2s.&#160;6d.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford is a distinctly amusing author.... In all her books there
is a “healthy absenteeism” of ethical purpose, and we have derived more genuine
pleasure from them than probably the most earnest student has ever obtained
from a chapter of “Robert Elsmere.”’—<cite>Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>MARVEL.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth, <strong>2s.&#160;6d.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>‘The author has long since created an imaginary world, peopled with more or
less natural figures; but her many admirers acknowledge the easy grace and inexhaustible
<i><span lang="fr">verve</span></i> that characterize her scenes of Hibernian life, and never tire of
the type of national heroine she has made her own.’—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<strong>3s.&#160;6d.</strong>; post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, <strong>2s.&#160;6d.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>‘There are in “Lady Verner’s Flight” several of the bright young people who
are wont to make Mrs. Hungerford’s books such very pleasant reading.... In
all the novels by the author of “Molly Bawn” there is a breezy freshness of treatment
which makes them most agreeable.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>THE RED-HOUSE MYSTERY.</strong> Crown 8vo., cloth
extra, <strong>3s.&#160;6d.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford is never seen to the best advantage when not dealing with
the brighter sides of life, or seeming to enjoy as much as her readers the ready
sallies and laughing jests of her youthful personages. In her present novel, however,
the heroine, if not all smiles and mirth, is quite as taking as her many predecessors,
while the spirit of uncontrolled mischief is typified in the American
heiress.’—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>THE THREE GRACES.</strong> 2 vols., crown 8vo., <strong>10s.</strong> net.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is impossible to deny that Mrs. Hungerford is capable of writing a charming
love-story, and that she proves her capacity to do so in “The Three Graces.”’—<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

<p class='c010'>The lamp was beginning to burn low; so was
the fire. But neither of the two people in
the room seemed to notice anything. The
Professor had got upon his discovery again,
and once there, no man living could check
him. He had flung his arms across the table
towards his companion, and the hands,
with the palms turned upwards, marked
every word as he uttered it, thumping the
knuckles on the table here, shaking some
imaginary disbeliever there—and never for
a moment quiet—such old, lean, shrivelled,
capable hands!</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>He was talking eagerly, as though the
words flowed to him faster than he could
utter them. This invention of his—this
supreme discovery—would make a revolution
in the world of science.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young man looking back at him from
the other side of the table listened intently.
He was a tall man of about eight-and-twenty,
and if not exactly handsome, very close to it.
His eyes were dark, and somewhat sombre,
and his mouth was thin-lipped, but kind, and
suggestive of a nature that was just, beyond
everything, if hardly sympathetic. It was a
beautiful mouth, at all events, and as he was
clean-shaven, one could see it as it was,
without veiling of any kind. Perhaps the
one profession of all others that most fully
declares itself in the face of its sons is that
of the law. A man who has been five years
a barrister is seldom mistaken for anything
else. Paul Wyndham was a barrister, and a
rising one—a man who loved his profession
for its own sake, and strove and fought to
make a name in it, though no such struggle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>was needful for his existence, as from his
cradle his lines had fallen to him in pleasant
places. He was master of a good fortune,
and heir to a title and ten thousand a year
whenever it should please Providence to take
his uncle, old Lord Shangarry, to an even
more comfortable home than that which he
enjoyed at present.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor had been his tutor years
ago, and the affection that existed between
them in those far-off years had survived the
changes of time and circumstance. The
Professor loved him—and him only on all
this wide earth. Wyndham had never
known a father; the Professor came as near
as any parent could, and in this new wild
theory of the old man’s he placed implicit
faith. It sounded wild, no doubt—it was
wild—but there was not in all Ireland a
cleverer man than the Professor, and who
was to say but it might have some grand
new meaning in it?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are sure of it?’ he said, looking at the
Professor with anxious but admiring eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>‘Sure! I have gone into it, I have studied
it for twenty years, I tell you. What, man,
d’ye think I’d speak of it even to you, if I
weren’t sure? I tell ye—I tell ye’—he grew
agitated and intensely Irish here—‘it will
shake the world!’</p>

<p class='c004'>The phrase seemed to please him; he drew
his arms off the table and lay back in his
chair as if revelling in it—as if chewing the
sweet cud of it in fancy. He saw in his
mind a day when in that old college of his
over there, only a few streets away—in
Trinity College—he should rise, and be
greeted by his old chums and his new pupils,
and the whole world of Dublin, with cheers
and acclamations. Nay! it would be more
than that—there would be London, and
Vienna, and Berlin. He put Berlin last
because, perhaps, he longed most of all for its
applause; but in these dreamings he came
back always to old Trinity, and found the
greatest sweetness in the laurels to be gained
there.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There can’t be a mistake,’ he went on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>more now as if reasoning with himself than
with his visitor, who was watching him, and
was growing a little uneasy at the pallor
that was showing itself round his nose and
mouth—a pallor he had noticed very often
of late when the old man was unduly excited
or interested. ‘I have gone through it again
and again. There is nothing new, of course,
under the sun, and there can be little doubt
but that it is an anæsthetic known to the
Indians of Southern America years ago,
and the Peruvians. There are records, but
nothing sufficient to betray the secret. It
was by the merest accident, as I have
told you, that I stumbled on it. I have
made many experiments. I have gone
cautiously step by step, until now all is sure.
So much for one hour. So much for six, so
much for twenty-four, so much’—his voice
rose almost to a scream, and he thumped his
hand violently on the table—‘for seven days—for
seven months!’</p>

<p class='c004'>His voice broke off, and he sank back in
his chair. The young man went quickly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>a cupboard and poured out a glass of some
white cordial.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thank you—thank you,’ said the Professor,
swallowing the nauseous mixture
hurriedly, as though regretting the waste of
time it took to drink it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why talk any more to-night?’ said the
young man anxiously; ‘I am going abroad
in a few days, but I can come again to see
you to-morrow. It is late.’ He glanced at
the clock, which pointed to ten minutes past
eleven. The movement he made in pointing
pushed aside his overcoat and showed that
he was in evening dress. He had evidently
been dining out, and had dropped in to see
the Professor—an old trick of his—on his
way home.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I must talk while I can,’ said the Professor,
smiling. The cordial, whatever it was,
had revived him, and he sat up and looked
again at his companion with eyes that were
brilliant. ‘As for this pain here,’ touching
his side, ‘it is nothing—nothing. What I
want to say, Paul, is this’—he bent towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Wyndham, and his lips quivered again with
excitement: ‘If I could send a human creature
to sleep for seven months, then why
not for seven years—for ever?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham looked at him incredulously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But the last time——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The last time you were here, I had not quite
perfected my discovery. But since then some
of my experiments have led me to think—to
be absolutely certain—that life can be sustained,
with all the appearance of death upon
the subject, for a full week at all events.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And when consciousness returns?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The subject treated wakes to life again
in exactly the same condition as when he or
she fell asleep—without loss of brain or body
power.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Seven days! A long time!’ The young
man smiled. ‘You bring back old thoughts
and dreams. Are you a second Friar
Laurence? Even he, though he could make
the fair Juliet sleep till all believed her
dead, could not prolong that unfortunate deception
beyond a certain limit.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>‘“And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>‘Less than two days—and yet, thou conjurer’—he
slapped the Professor’s arm gaily—‘you
would talk of keeping one in death’s
bonds for years!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ay, years!’ The Professor looked back
at him, and his eyes shone. Old age seemed
to slip from him, and for the moment a
transient youth was his again. ‘This is but
a beginning—a mere start; but if it succeeds—if
life can be sustained by means of this
drug alone for seven days, why not for
months and years?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You forget one thing,’ said the young
man. ‘Who would care for it? Why should
one care to lie asleep for years?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Many!’ said the Professor slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He ceased, and a strange gloom shadowed
his face. His thoughts had evidently gone
backward into a long-dead past—a past that
still lived. ‘Have you no imagination?’ he
said at last reproachfully. ‘Think, boy—think!
When affliction falls on one, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>a grievous sorrow tears the heart, who would
not wish for an oblivion that would be longer
than a sleeping-draught could give, and less
pernicious than suicide?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The same refusal in both cases to meet
and face one’s doom,’ said the young man.
‘You would create a new generation of
cowards.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Pshaw!  there will be cowards without
me,’ said the Professor. ‘But here, again,
take another case. A man, we will say, has
had his leg cut off—well, let him sleep
until the leg is well, and he will escape all
the twinges, the agonizing pains of the recovery.
This is but one instance; all surgical
cases could be treated so, and so much pain
saved in this most painful world.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, I confess a charm lies there!’ said
Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It does. And yet it is to the other
thought I lean—to the dread of memory
where grief and shame lie.’ The Professor’s
gaunt face lost again its short return of
youth, and grew grim, and aged, and white.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>‘See,’ he leant towards Wyndham, and
pressed him into a chair beside the dying
fire, ‘to you—to you alone I have revealed
this matter: not so much because you have
been my pupil, as that you have a hold on
me. You think me dry, and hard, and old.
All that is true. But’—his voice grew if
possible harsher than ever—‘I have an affection
for you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed almost ludicrous to think of the
Professor as having an affection for anything
beyond his science and his discovery, with
his bald head, and his bleared eyes, and his
cold, forbidding face. The young man gazed
at him with pardonable astonishment. That
the Professor liked him, trusted him, was
quite easy to understand—but the word
‘affection’!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It surprises you,’ said the old man slowly,
perhaps a little sadly. ‘Yet there was a
time——’ He moved and poked the fire into
a sullen blaze. ‘I married,’ he said presently.
‘And she—well, I loved her, I think. It seems
hard to remember now, it is so long ago, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>believe I had a heart then, and it was hers.
She died.’ He poked the fire again, and
most of it fell into the grate—it was all
cinders by this time, and the younger man
shivered. ‘It was well. Looking back upon
it now,’ said the Professor coldly, ‘I am
glad she died. She would have interfered
with my studies. Her death left me free;
but for that freedom, I should never have
found out this.’ He tapped some papers
lying loosely on the table—three or four
pages, no more, with only a line or two upon
them—vague suggestions of the great discovery
that was to shake the world, so vague
as to be useless to anyone but himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You had no children, then?’ asked Wyndham,
who had never even heard that he was
married until now.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘One.’ The Professor paused, and the
silence grew almost insupportable. ‘He,
too, is dead. And that, too, is well. He
was of no use. He only burdened the
world.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But——’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>‘Not a question——’ The old man silenced
him. ‘I cast him off.’ There was something
terrible in the indifference with which he said
this. ‘He was a fool—a criminal one. I
heard later that he had married—no doubt
as great a fool as himself. I hope so. Set a
thief to catch a thief, you know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed bitterly—the cruel, mirthless
laugh of the embittered old. ‘For the rest,
I know nothing,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You made no inquiries?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘None. Why should I?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He was your son.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, does that make a black thing
white? No—no! My son—my child is
here!’ He touched the loose papers with a
loving hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham did not pursue the subject
further, and as if to show that it was ended,
he stooped and threw some coals upon the
fire that now seemed to be at its last gasp.
A tiny smoke flew up between the fresh
lumps, and after that came a little uncertain
blaze. The fire had caught the coals.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The Professor had gone back to his heart’s
desire.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To see the blossom of my labour bear
fruit—that is my sole, my last demand from
life. I have so short a time to live that I
would hasten the fulfilment of my hopes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You mean——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That I want to see the drug used on a
human being. I have approached the matter
with some of the authorities at Kilmainham,
with a view to getting a condemned criminal
to experiment upon; but up to this I have
been refused, and in such a presumptuous
manner as leads me to fear I shall never
receive a better answer. Surely a man respited
for seven days, as has been the case
occasionally, might as well risk those seven
days in the cause of science.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham shrugged his shoulders. ‘I
have never met that man,’ said he. But the
Professor did not hear him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The most humane people in the world,’
said he, ‘refuse help to the man who has
devoted twenty years of his life to the cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of humanity. Such an anæsthetic as mine
would work a revolution in the world of
medicine. As I have told you, a man might
not only be unconscious whilst a limb was
being lopped off, but might remain so until
the wound was healed, and then, made free of
pain and perfectly well, be able to take his
part in the world again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It sounds like a fairy-tale,’ said Wyndham,
smiling. ‘You have, I suppose, made
many experiments?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘On animals, yes—and of late without a
single failure; but on a human body, no.
As yet no opportunity has been afforded me.
Either jealousy or fear has stopped my march,
which I feel would be a triumphal one were
the road made clear. I tell you I have
addressed many leading men of science on
the subject. I have asked them to be
present. I would have everything above
board, as you who know me can testify. I
would have all men look on and bear witness
to the splendour of my discovery.’ Here
again the Professor’s strange deep eyes grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>brilliant, once again that queer flash of a
youth long ago departed was his. ‘I would
have it shown to all the world in a blaze of
light. But no man will take heed or listen.
They laugh. They scoff. They will not
countenance the chance of my killing someone;
as if’—violently—‘the loss of one poor
human life was to be counted, when the relief
of millions is in the balance.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He sank back as if exhausted, and then
went on, his tone hard, yet excited:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now it has come to this. If the chance
were given me of trying my discovery on
man, woman, or child, I should take it, without
the sanction of the authorities, and with
it that other chance of being hanged afterwards
if the experiment failed.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You feel so sure as that?’ questioned
Wyndham. The old man’s enthusiasm had
caught him. He too was looking eager and
excited.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Sure!’ The Professor rose, gaunt, haggard,
and with eyes that flashed fire beneath
the pent brows that overhung them. ‘I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>would stake my soul—nay, more, my reputation—on
the success of my discovery. Oh
for a chance to prove it!’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this moment there was a low knock at
the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>The handle was turned, and the door opened
with a considerable amount of caution (the
Professor did not permit interruptions). It
was evidently, however, the caution of one
who was suppressing badly a wild desire to
make a rush into the room, and presently a
man’s head appeared round the corner of the
door, and after it his body. He came a yard
or two beyond the threshold, and then stood
still. His reddish hair was standing out a
little, and his small twinkling Irish eyes were
blinking nervously. He looked eagerly first
at the younger man, who was his master, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>then at the Professor, and then back again at
Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, Denis?’ said the latter, a little impatiently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If ye plaze, sir, there’s an unfortunate
young faymale on the steps below.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor frowned. As if such an
ordinary occurrence as that should be allowed
to interfere with a discussion on the great
discovery! Wyndham spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If she is noisy or troublesome, you had
better call a policeman,’ he said indifferently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Noisy! Divil a sound out of her,’ said
Denis. ‘She looks for all the world, yer
honour, as if there wasn’t a spark o’ life left
in her. Sthretched in the hall she is, an’ the
colour o’ death.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In the hall?’ said Wyndham quickly. ‘I
thought you said she was on the steps.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She was. She’—cautiously—‘was.
But——’ He paused and scanned anxiously
the two faces before him. ‘It’s bitther cowld
outside to-night, so I tuk her in.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>And, indeed, though the month was May,
a searching wind was shaking the city, and
biting into the hearts of young and old. As
often happens in that ‘merrie month,’ a light
fall of snow was whitening the tops of the
houses.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I had better see to this,’ said the young
man, rising. He left the room, followed by
Denis (who had stopped to throw a few more
coals on the now cheerful fire), and went
down to the cold, bare, hideous hall below.
The light from the solitary gas-lamp scarcely
lit it, and it took him a few seconds to discern
something that lay on the worn tarpaulin at
the lower end of it. At last he made it out,
and, stepping nearer, saw that it was the
figure of a young and very slight girl. She
was lying on the ground, her back supported
against a chair, and Wyndham could see that
Denis had folded an old coat of the Professor’s
that usually hung on the hat-stand,
and placed it behind her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>The light was so dim that he could not see
what she was like; but stooping over her, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>felt her hands, and found that they were cold
as ice. Instinct, however, told him that life
still ran within her veins, and lifting her
quickly in his arms, he carried her upstairs
to the room he had just left, and where the
Professor still sat, so lost in fresh dreams of
the experiment yet to be made that he
started as Wyndham re-entered the room
with his strange burden; it was, indeed, with
difficulty that he brought his mind back to
the present moment. He had forgotten why
the young man had left the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She seems very ill,’ said Wyndham. His
man had followed him, and now, through a
sign from his master, he pulled forward a
huge armchair, in which Wyndham placed
the unconscious girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor came nearer and stared down
at her. She was very young—hardly eighteen—but
already Misery or Want, or both, had
seized and laid their cruel hands upon her,
dabbing in dark bistre shades beneath her
eyes, and making sad hollows in her pallid
cheeks. The lips, white now, were firmly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>closed as if in death, but something about
the formation of them suggested the idea
that even in life they could be firm too.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a face that might be beautiful if
health had warmed it, and if joy had found
a seat within the heart that now seemed at
its last ebb. The lashes lying on the white,
cold cheek were singularly long and dark,
and Wyndham roused himself suddenly to
find himself wondering what could be the
colour of the eyes that lay hidden behind
that wonderful fringe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her gown was of blue serge, neatly, even
elegantly made, and the collar and cuffs she
wore were quite primitive in their whiteness
and simplicity. She had no hat or cloak
with her, but a little gray woollen shawl had
been evidently twisted round her head. Now
it had fallen back, leaving all the glory of her
rich chestnut hair revealed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Involuntarily the young man glanced at
her left hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no ring there. An intense
wave of pity swept over him. Another!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Dear God! what cruel sorrows lie within
this world of Yours!</p>

<p class='c004'>The face was so young, so free of hardness,
vice, or taint of any kind, that his very heart
bled for her. Misery alone seemed to mark
it. That was deeply stamped. Looking at
her, he almost hoped that she would never
wake again—that she was really dead; but
even as this thought crossed his mind, she
stirred, sighed softly, and opened her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>For awhile she gazed at them—on the
Professor, impassive, silent; on the younger
man, anxious, pained—and then with a sharp,
quick movement she released herself from
the arm Wyndham had placed round her,
and raised herself to a sitting posture.
There was such terror in her eyes as she did
this that the younger man hastened to reassure
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are quite safe here,’ he said kindly.
The girl looked at him, then cast a frightened
glance past him, and over his shoulder, as
though looking fearfully for some dreaded
object. ‘My man found you on the steps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>outside. You were ill—fainting, he said—so
he brought you in here to’—with a gesture
towards the Professor—‘this gentleman’s
house.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl looked anxiously at the Professor,
who nodded as in duty bound, but who
seemed unmistakably bored, for all that, and
angry enough to frighten her afresh.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you will tell us where you live,’ said
Wyndham gently, ‘we shall see that you are
taken back there.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl shrank visibly. She caught the
little shawl that had slipped from her, and
drew it round her head once more, almost
hiding her face.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can find my own way,’ she said. The
voice was low, musical; it trembled, and as
she moved forward to pass Wyndham, so did
she. She even tottered, so much, indeed, that
she was obliged to catch hold of a table near
to keep herself from falling.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is impossible for you to walk to-night,’
said the young man earnestly. ‘And there
is no necessity for it. My servant is at your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>disposal; he can call a cab for you, and he is
quite to be trusted; he will see you to your
home.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl hesitated for a moment, then lifted
her heavy eyes to his.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have no home,’ she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a very forlorn answer, and it went
to Wyndham’s heart. God help her, poor
girl! whoever she was. He glanced again at
her clothes, which were decidedly above the
average of the extremely wretched, and he
was conscious of a certain curiosity with
regard to her—a distinctly kindly one.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl caught the glance and turned
away her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You can at least say where you want to be
driven,’ said he gravely, but with sympathy;
he hesitated for a moment, and then went on.
‘No questions will be asked,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She made no answer to this, and while he
waited for one the Professor broke in impatiently:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Come, girl, speak! Where do you want
to go? Where do you live?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>On this followed another shorter silence,
and then at last she spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall not go back,’ she said. Her tone
was low, but defiant, and very firm.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That means you will not tell,’ said the
Professor. ‘Then go—do you hear—go!
You are interrupting us here.’ He motioned
towards the door, where Denis stood mute as
a sentinel; he was, indeed, an old soldier, for
the matter of that.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl stepped quickly, eagerly forward,
but Wyndham stopped her imperatively, and
standing between her and the door, he spoke
to the Professor.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is impossible to turn her out at this
hour—in this weather.’ He stopped, and
now looked at the girl and spoke to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why can’t you trust us?’ he said, with
angry reproach. ‘Why can’t you let us do
something for you? You must have a home
somewhere, however bad.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl thus addressed turned upon him
suddenly with miserable passion shining in
her large, dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>‘I have not,’ she said. ‘Under the sky of
God, there is no creature so homeless as I am.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Her passion was so great that it struck
the listeners into silence. She made a little
gesture with her arms suggestive of awful
weariness, then spoke again:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There was a place where I lived yesterday.
It was not a home. I shall not live
there again. I have left it. I shall not go
back.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But where, then, are you going?’ asked
Wyndham impulsively.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know.’ She drew her breath
slowly, heavily. It was hardly a sigh. There
was enough misery in it for ten sighs. But
her passion was all gone, and a terrible indifference
had taken its place; and there was
such consummate despair in her tone as might
have touched even the Professor. But it did
not. He had begun to study her. He was
always studying people, and now a curious
expression had crept into his face. He leaned
forward and peered at her. There was no
compassion in the glance, no interest whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>in her as a suffering human thing; but
there was a sudden sharp interest in her as a
means to a desired end. Thought was in his
glance, and a wild longing that was fast
growing to a hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Have you no plans, then?’ asked the
young man. His tone was sad. He had
looked into the depths of her dark eyes, and
found there no guile at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘None!’ She was silent awhile, and then
very slowly she raised her head; her brows
contracted, and she looked past them both
into vacancy. If she was communing with
her own heart, the results were very sad.
Despair itself gathered in her eyes. She
turned presently and looked at Wyndham.
‘I wish,’ said she, with a forlorn look, ‘that
I had the courage to die.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It was unutterably sad, this young
creature, with all her life before her, praying
for courage to end it; craving for death
in the midst of life, wishing she had the
courage to escape from a world that had
evidently given her but a sorry welcome.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Wyndham looked round at the Professor
as if expecting him to join in his commiseration
for this poor, unhappy child, but what
he saw in the Professor’s face checked him.
It startled him, and stopped the tide of
sympathy for a time—as great floods will for
the moment always catch and carry with
them the milder rushes of the rivers near.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor’s face was indeed a study.
It was radiant—alight with a strange and
sudden hope. His piercing eyes were fixed
immovably upon the girl. They seemed to
burn into her as though demanding and compelling
an answering glance from hers.</p>

<p class='c004'>She obeyed the call; slowly, languidly she
lifted her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So you would die?’ said he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’ The word fell listlessly from her lips;
but she stared straight at him as she said
it, and her young unhappy face looked nearly
as gray as the old merciless one bending
over it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then why live?’ pursued he. ‘Death is
easy.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>‘No, it is hard,’ she said. ‘And I am
afraid of pain.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If there were no pain, you would risk it,
then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She hesitated. His glance was now, indeed,
so wild, so full of frantic eagerness, that it
might readily have frightened one older in
the world’s ways. To Wyndham, waiting,
watching, it occurred that the Professor was
like a spider creeping towards its prey. He
shuddered.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Speak, girl, speak!’ said the Professor.
His agitation was intense, and almost beyond
control. Here—here to his hand was his
chance. Was he to have it at last, or lose
it for ever? Wyndham could stand it no
longer; he went quickly forward, and, standing
between the Professor and the girl, took
the former by the shoulders and pushed him
gently backwards and out of hearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If this drug of yours possesses the lifegiving
properties you speak of,’ said he
sternly, ‘why speak to her of death? Do
you honestly believe in this experiment? Or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>do you fear it—when you suggest this sort
of suicide to her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I fear nothing,’ said the old man. ‘But
we are all mortal. We can all err, even in
our surest judgments. The very cleverest
of us can be deceived. The experiment—though
I do not believe it—might fail.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At the word ‘fail’ he roused.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It will not! It cannot!’ he cried, with
vehemence. ‘But in the meantime I would
give her her chance, too. She shall know
the worst that may befall her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why not tell her all?’ said the young man
anxiously. ‘It’—he hesitated and coloured
faintly—‘it would give her her chance perhaps
in another world if your experiment failed.
It would take from her—in part—the sin of
deliberately destroying herself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor shrugged his shoulders. He
thought it waste of time, this preparing for
another world—another Judge.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think, then, that I should tell her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I do. I think, too,’ said Wyndham
strongly, ‘that if your experiment succeeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>you should consider yourself indebted to her
for ever.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall see to her future, of course.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If,’ said the young man gloomily, ‘anyone
could see to the future of such a one as she is!’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor looked at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are out of sorts to-night,’ he said.
‘Your natural instinct is deadened in you.
That girl does not belong to the class of
which you are thinking. Whatever has
driven her to her present desperate state of
mind, it is not impurity.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You think that?’ Wyndham looked
doubtful, but was still conscious of a faint
wave of relief; and the Professor, watching
him, smiled, the tolerant smile of one who
understands the cranks and follies of poor
human nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If so,’ said Wyndham quickly, ‘she should
surely not be subjected to this experiment at
all. She——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For all that, I shall not lose this chance,’
said the Professor shortly. He turned and
went back to the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>She was sitting in the same attitude as
when he left her—her hands clenched upon
her knees, her eyes staring into the fire.
God alone knew what she saw there. She
did not change her position, but sat like that,
immovable as a statue, as the Professor expounded
his experiment to her, and then
asked her the cold, unsympathetic question
as to whether, now she knew what the risk
was, she would accept it. It might mean
death, but if not, it would mean safety and
protection in the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he had finished, she turned her
sombre eyes on his.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I will take the risk,’ she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham made a movement as if to speak,
but the Professor checked him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course, if the experiment is successful,’
he said, ‘I shall provide for you for life.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope you will not have to provide for
me,’ she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this, a little silence fell upon the
room, that seemed to chill it. The Professor
broke it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>‘You agree, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I agree.’ She rose, and held out her hand.
‘Give me the draught.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham started, his voice vibrating with
horror.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no!’ he cried. ‘She does not understand;
and’—to the Professor—‘neither do
you. If this thing fails, it will mean murder.
Think, I entreat you, before it is too late to
think. That girl’—pointing to the young
stranger, who was standing regarding him
with a dull curiosity—‘she is but a child.
She cannot know her own mind. She ought
not to be allowed to settle so stupendous a
question. Look at her!’ His voice shook.
‘Many a happier girl at her age would still
be in her schoolroom. She is so young that,
whatever her wrongs, her sorrows may be,
she has still time before her to conquer or
live them down. Professor, I implore you,
do not go on with this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor rested a contemptuous glance
on him for a moment, then swept it from him,
and addressed the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>‘You are willing?’ he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’ She spoke quite firmly, but she was
looking at Wyndham. It was a strange look,
made up of surprise and some other feeling
hardly defined.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is not all,’ broke in Wyndham again,
vehemently. ‘There is you to be considered,
too. If this sleep of your making terminates
fatally, have you considered the consequences
to yourself?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor smiled. He pointed to the
girl, who stood marble-white beneath the dull
gaslight.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Like her, I take the risk,’ he said. ‘I
think I told you a little while ago that I
would chance the hanging.’ His smile—a
very unpleasant one—faded suddenly, and
his manner grew brusque and arrogant.
‘There—enough,’ he said. ‘Stand aside,
man. Do you think that now—now when
at last my hour has come—I am likely
to let it slip, though death itself lay before
me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For God’s sake, Professor, think yet a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>moment!’ said the younger man, holding him
in his grasp. ‘She is young—so young!...
To take a life like that!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am going to take no life’—coldly. ‘I
see now that you never had any faith in me
at all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I believe in you as no other man does,’
rejoined Wyndham hotly. ‘But surely at
this supreme moment a doubt may be allowed
me. If this thing were done openly in the
eye of day, in sight of all men, it were well;
but to try so deadly an experiment here,
at midnight—with no witnesses, as it were—great
heavens! you must see the pitfall you
are laying for yourself. If this experiment
fails——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It will not fail,’ said the Professor coldly.
‘In the meantime’—he cast a scornful glance
at him—‘if you are afraid of being called as
a witness, it is’—pointing to the door—‘still
open to you to avoid such a disagreeability.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Their eyes met.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think I have deserved that,’ said
the other proudly, and all at once in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>queer hour both men felt that the tie that
had bound them for years was stronger than
they knew.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Stay, then,’ said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went into an inner room and returned
with a phial and glass, and advanced towards
the girl with an almost buoyant step. There
was, indeed, an exhilaration in his whole air,
that amounted almost to madness. He looked
wild—spectral, indeed—in the dim light of
the solitary lamp, with his white hair thrown
back and his eyes shining fiercely beneath
the rugged brows.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you ready?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>She made a slight gesture of assent, and
went a step or two to meet him. She was
deadly pale, but she stood without support
of any kind. The Professor poured some of
the pale fluid from the phial into the glass
with a hand that never faltered, and the girl
took it with a hand that faltered quite as
little; but before she could raise it to her
lips, Wyndham caught her arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Stop!’ cried he, as if choking. ‘Have you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>thought—have you considered that there is
no certainty in this drug?’ Her eyes rested
for a moment on his.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I thought there was a certainty,’ she said
slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A certainty of death, perhaps,’ said he,
poignant fear in his tone. ‘At this last
moment I appeal to you, for your own sake.
Don’t take it. If you do, it is doubtful
whether you will ever come back to life again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at him steadily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope there is no doubt,’ she said. She
raised the glass and drank its contents to the
dregs.</p>

<p class='c004'>As she did so, some clock in the silent city
outside struck the midnight hour.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>‘A land of darkness, as darkness itself, and of the
shadow of death; without any order, and where the
light is as darkness.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Morning had broken through the sullen
gloom of night, and still the two men
watched beside the couch on which the girl
lay, seemingly, in all the tranquillity of death.
The Professor’s drug had been calculated to
keep her asleep for exactly six hours. So
long a time would be a test. If she lived,
and woke at the right time, then he would
try again. He would make it worth her
while. For the younger man, during this
anxious vigil, there had been passing lapses
of memory, that he, however, would have
disdained to acknowledge as sleep; but with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the old man there had been no question of
oblivion, and now, as the vital moment
drew near that should test the truth of the
great discovery, even Wyndham grew abnormally
wide-awake, and with nervous
heart-sinkings watched the pale, death-like
face of the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>Could it be unreal? Wyndham rose once
and bent over her. No faintest breath came
from her lips or nostrils; the whole face had
taken the pinched, ashen appearance of one
who had lain for a full day dead. The
hands were waxen, and the forehead too.
He shuddered and drew back. At that
moment he told himself that she was dead,
and that he had undoubtedly assisted at a
form of murder.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to the Professor, who was
sitting watch in hand, counting the moments.
He would have spoken, but the old man’s
grim face forbade him. He was waiting.
At twelve o’clock the girl had sunk into a
slumber so profound, so representative of
death, that Wyndham had uttered an exclamation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of despair, and had told himself
she was indeed struck down by the Destroyer,
and now when six o’clock strikes
she ought to rise from her strange slumbers
if the Professor’s drug possessed the powerful
properties attributed to it by its discoverer.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Wyndham stood watching the Professor,
a sound smote upon his ear. One! Again
the city clock was tolling the hour. The
Professor rose; his face was ghastly. One,
two, three, four, five, six!</p>

<p class='c004'>Six! The Professor bent down over the
girl, and Wyndham went near to him, to be
ready to help him when the moment came—when
the truth was made clear to him that
his discovery had failed. Wyndham himself
had long ago given up hope, but he feared for
the old man, to whom his discovery had been
more than life or love for over twenty years.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor still stood peering into the
calm face. Six, and no sign, no change!</p>

<p class='c004'>Already the sun’s rays were beginning to
peep sharply through the window; there was
a slight stir in the street below. Six-thirty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>and still the Professor stood gazing on the
quiet figure, as motionless as it. Seven
o’clock, and still no movement. The face,
now lovely in its calm, was as marble, and
the limbs lay rigid, the fingers lightly locked.
Death, death alone could look like that!</p>

<p class='c004'>Half-past seven! As the remorseless clock
recorded the time, the Professor suddenly
threw up his arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is dead!’ he said. ‘Oh, my God!’</p>

<p class='c004'>He reeled forward, and the young man
caught him in his arms. He was almost
insensible, and was gasping for breath.
Wyndham carried him into an adjoining
room and laid him on a bed, and, finding
him cold, covered him with blankets. This,
so far as it went, was well enough for the
moment, but what was the next step to be?
The old man lay gasping, and evidently there
was but a short step between his state and
that of his victim outside. Yet how to send
for a doctor with that victim outside? To
the Professor, whose hours were numbered,
it would mean little or nothing; but to him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Wyndham, it would mean, if not death,
eternal disgrace. He drew a long breath
and bent over the Professor, who was now
again sensible.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Shall I send for Marks or Drewd?’ he
asked, naming two of the leading physicians
in Dublin.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor grasped his arm; his face
grew frightful.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No one—no one!’ he gasped. ‘Are you
mad? Do you think I would betray my
failure to the world? To have them laugh—deride——’
He fell back, gasping still, but
menacing the young man with his eye. By
degrees the fury of his glance relaxed, and
he fell into a sort of slumber, always holding
Wyndham’s arm, however, as if fearing he
should go. He seemed stronger, and Wyndham
knelt by the bed, wondering vaguely
what was going to be the end of it all, and
whether it would be possible to remove the
corpse outside without detection. There
was Denis—Denis was faithful, and could
be trusted.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Presently the Professor roused from his fit
of unconsciousness. He looked up at the
young man, and his expression was terrible.
Despair in its worse form disfigured his
features. The dream of a life had been
extinguished. He tried to speak, but at
first words failed him, then, ‘All the years—all
the years!’ he mumbled. Wyndham
understood, and his heart bled. The old
man had given the best years of his life
to his discovery, and now——</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have killed her!’ went on the Professor,
after a minute or two.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Science has killed her,’ said Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; I, with my cursed pride of belief in
myself—I have killed her,’ persisted the old
man. ‘I would to God it were not so!’ He
did not believe in anything but science, yet
he appealed to the Creator occasionally, as
some moderns still do to Jove. His lean
fingers beat feebly on the blankets. ‘A
failure—a failure,’ he kept muttering, his
eyes fixed on vacancy. ‘I go to my grave
a failure! I set my soul on it. I believed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>in it, and it was naught.’ He was rambling,
but presently he sprang into a sitting posture,
his eyes afire once more. ‘I believe in it
still!’ he shouted. ‘Oh, for time, for life, to
prove.... O God, if there is a God, grant
me a few more days!’ He fell into a violent
fit of shivering, and Wyndham gently laid
him back in his bed, and covered him again
with the blankets, where he lay sullen,
powerless.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Try not to think,’ implored the young
man.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Think—think—what else is left to me?
Oh, Paul!’ He stretched out his arm and
caught Wyndham. ‘That it should be a
failure after all. I wish——’ He paused,
and then went on: ‘I wish I had not tried it
upon her; she was young. She was a pretty
creature, too. She was like&#160;... someone——’
He broke off.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She was a mere waif and stray,’ said
Wyndham, trying to harden his voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She was no waif or stray of the sort you
mean,’ said the Professor. ‘Her face—was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>not like that. There’—pointing to the room
outside—‘go; look on her for yourself, and
read the truth of what I say.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is not necessary,’ said the young man,
with a slight shudder. And again a silence
fell between them. It was again broken by
the Professor.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She was full of life,’ he said; ‘and I
took it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She wished you to take it,’ said Wyndham,
who felt choking. Her blood seemed to lie
heavily on him. Had he not seen, countenanced
her murder? The Professor did not
seem to hear him; his head had fallen forward,
and he was muttering again.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is dead!’ he whispered to himself.
He made a vague but tragic gesture; and
then, after a little while, ‘Dead!’ he said
again. His head had sunk upon his breast.
It was a strange scene. Here the Professor
dying—out there the girl dead—and between
them he, Paul Wyndham. What lay before
him?</p>

<p class='c004'>He roused himself with an effort from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>horrible thoughts, and made a faint effort to
withdraw his hand from the Professor’s; but
though the latter had fallen into a doze,
he still felt the attempt at withdrawal, and
tightened his clutch on Wyndham; and all
at once it seemed to the young man as though
the years had rolled backward, and he was
still the pupil, and this old man his tutor,
and the days were once more present when
he had been ordered here and there, and had
taken his directions from him, and loved and
reverenced him, stern and repellent as he was,
as perhaps no tutor had ever been reverenced
before.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a little while the Professor’s grasp
relaxed, and Wyndham rose to his feet. A
shrinking from entering the room beyond was
combated by a wild desire to go there and
look once again upon the slender form of the
girl lying in death’s sweet repose upon her
couch. He went to the door, hesitated involuntarily
for a second or two, and then
entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>How still is death! And how apart!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Nothing can approach it or move it. He
looked at her long and earnestly, and all at
once it came to him that she was beautiful.
He had not thought her beautiful last night,
but now the dignity of death had touched
her, and her fear and her indifference and
her despair had dropped from her, and the
face shone lovely—the features chiselled, and
a vague smile upon the small, closed lips.
He noticed one thing, and it struck him as
strange—that pinched look about the features
that he had noticed an hour ago was gone
now. The mouth was soft, the rounded chin
curved as if in life. Almost there seemed a
little bloom upon the pale, cold cheeks.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a heavy sigh he turned away, and,
leaning his arm upon the mantelshelf, gave
himself up a prey to miserable thought.
The fire had died out long ago, and the
morning was cold and raw, and from under
the ill-fitting door a little harsh wind was
rushing. The Professor, though actually a
rich man, had never cared to change the undesirable
house that had sheltered him when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>first he tried a fall with fortune, and, conquering
it, came out at once to the front as a man
not to be despised in the world of science.</p>

<p class='c004'>What was to be done? The Professor
would have to see a doctor, even if the medical
man were brought in without his knowledge.
Would it be possible to remove the—that girl—and
trust to to-night for her removal to——To
where? Again he lost himself in a sea
of agonized doubt and uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Denis would still be here, of course; but
what could Denis do? He fell back upon all
the old methods of concealing dead bodies he
had ever heard of, but everything seemed
impossible. What fools all those others must
have been! Well, he could give himself up
and explain matters; but then the Professor—to
have his great discovery derided and
held up to ridicule! The old man’s look, as
he saw it a little while ago, seemed to forbid
his betrayal of his defeat. Great heavens!
what was to be done?</p>

<p class='c004'>He drew himself up with a heavy sigh, and
passed his hand across his eyes, then turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to go back to the inner room to see if the
Professor was still sleeping. As he went he
tried to avoid glancing at the couch where
the dead form lay, but when he got close,
some force stronger than his will compelled
him to look at it. And as he looked he felt
turned into stone. He seemed frozen to the
spot on which he stood; his eyes refused to
remove themselves from what they saw.
Staring like one benumbed, he told himself
at last that he was going mad. How otherwise
could he see this thing? Sweat broke
out on his forehead, and a cry escaped him.
The corpse was looking at him!</p>

    <div>‘Look, then, into thine heart and write!’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Very intently, too, and as if surprised or
trying to remember. Her large eyes seemed
singularly brilliant, and for a while the only
thing living about her. But all at once, as
though memory had returned, she sprang to
her feet and stood, strong, and utterly without
support, and questioned him with those
eyes silently but eloquently. The queerest
thing about it all to Wyndham was that,
instead of being enfeebled by the strange
draught she had drunk, she looked younger,
more vigorous, and altogether another person
from the forlorn, poor child of eight hours
ago. Her eyes were now like stars, her lips
red and warm; the drug had, beyond doubt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>a property that even the Professor had never
dreamt of; it gave not only rest, but renewed
health and life to those who drank it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Seeing Wyndham did not or could not
speak, she did.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am alive—alive!’ she cried, with young
and happy exultation. Where was the desire
for death that lay so heavily on her only a
few hours ago? It was all gone. Now it
was plain that she desired life—life only.
Her voice rang through the room fresh and
clear, filling it with music of a hope renewed,
and so penetrating that it even pierced into
the room beyond. And as it reached it,
another cry broke forth—a cry this time old
and feeble.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham rushed to answer it, taking with
him his last memory of the girl, as she then
stood, with her arms thrown out as if in quick
delight, and her whole strange, beautiful face
one ray of gladness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Professor was sitting up in bed a mere
wreck, but with expectation on every feature.
He was trembling visibly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>‘That voice!’ he whispered wildly—‘that
voice! I know it. Long years ago I knew it.
Boy, speak—tell me, whose voice was that?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham knelt down beside him, and
took his hand in his. He, too, was trembling
excessively, and his eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Sir,’ he said softly, ‘she is alive.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She—she—who?’ asked the Professor.
He bent forward; his features were working.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That girl&#160;... last night.... She lives,
sir. Your experiment has not failed, after all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He feared to look at the Professor when
he had said this, and bent his head, leaning
his forehead on the wrinkled hand he held.
It quivered slightly beneath him, but not
much, and presently the old man spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She lives?’ His voice was stronger now.
Wyndham looked up, and found the Professor
looking almost his normal self, and
with that expression in his eyes that the
young man knew as meaning a sharp calculation.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; I have spoken to her. Will you
see her?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>‘No.’ The Professor silenced him by a
gesture. He was evidently in the midst of
a quick calculation now.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The hour she woke?’  he asked presently,
with such a vigorous ring in his tone that
Wyndham rose to his feet astonished.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Two minutes ago.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hah!’ The Professor went back to his
calculations. Presently a shout broke from
him. ‘I see it now!’ he cried victoriously;
‘I see where the mistake lay! Fool that I
was not to have seen it before! It was a
miscalculation, but one easy to be rectified.
An hour or two will do it. Here, help me
up, Paul.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, Professor, it is impossible; you must
rest; you——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not another moment, not one, I tell you!’
cried the Professor furiously. He lunged out
of bed. ‘This thing must be seen to at once.
What time can any man be sure of, that he
should waste it? The discovery must be
assured. And what time have I?’</p>

<p class='c004'>He fell forward; he had fainted. Wyndham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>laid him back, and rushed frantically
into the next room.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl was standing just where he had
left her. But her arms were outstretched no
longer; they were better employed—they
were doing up her hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a glass on a wall opposite to
him, and by this she was trying to bring herself
back to as perfect a state of respectability
as circumstances permitted her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You must go,’ said Wyndham, ‘and at
once. Do you hear—at once?’</p>

<p class='c004'>And, indeed, it was imperative that she
should be out of the house before the arrival
of the doctor, for whom he was now about
to go.</p>

<p class='c004'>She rose. And suddenly gladness died from
her face, her arms dropped to her sides; something
of the old misery, but not all, settled
down on her once more.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can go,’ she said. ‘I—I am not so afraid
now, when it is day; but—he said——’</p>

<p class='c004'>Poor child! she had remembered the bargain
of the night before. She had not thought it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>worthy of thought then, believing Death
indeed lay before her when she drank that
draught; but when she woke, when memory
returned to her (and it always came quickly
after such a draught as that), she had gladly
told herself that now all her troubles were at
an end, that the old man would provide for
her, protect her. And now this young man,
so forbidding, so unkind, with his harsh voice
and ways; and yet last night he had seemed
so kind!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He is dying!’ said Wyndham shortly. ‘A
doctor must be summoned without delay. I
shall arrange for your going—for your safety;
but you must be quick.’ He rang the bell
for Denis, who was waiting for him below.
The Professor’s only servant was a charwoman,
who left nightly at ten, and did not return
till the same time next morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You need provide for nothing,’ said the
girl. She caught up the little shawl that
had been wrapped round her last night, and
moved towards the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Stay a moment; you can’t go like this,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>said the young man distractedly. ‘I have a
servant who will take you to some place of
safety. It is impossible that you should go
like this. Why’—awkwardly—‘you haven’t
even got a bonnet.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She stopped and looked at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is not you who are responsible,’ she
said. ‘And’—she drew her breath quickly—‘after
all, no one is. I took that drug of
my own accord, of my own will, but he did
promise to—to—— But if he is dying?’
She looked at him anxiously, making the last
speech a question.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am afraid so.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then that is at an end.’ She went towards
the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Wait for my servant,’ entreated he, following
her and laying a hand upon her arm.
‘I cannot allow you to go like this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t see what it is to you,’ said she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is much—a great deal. For one thing,
the Professor, if he recovers, would never
forgive me for letting you go out of his life
without reparation—without the fulfilment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of his promise to you. He is indebted to you,
remember. It’—eagerly—‘was a bargain.
And, after all, if you throw off his responsibility
now, where will you go? You say
you have no home—no——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nothing! nothing!’ she said. He could
see her face pale again, and again that dreadful
look of despair, of hopelessness, that had
crowned her last night, aged and made miserable
her face.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned gladly from the sad contemplation
of it to address Denis, who had entered
the room, his small twinkling eyes as bright
as ever; but, then, he had slept tranquilly
the whole night through by a kitchen fire
that would have been hard to rival in heat
and brilliancy. Amongst all Denis’s many
virtues, one stood out: he could always be
depended on to look after himself. And
really that is a great thing in a faithful
servant; so many of them like to pose as
martyrs in the cause.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham led his servant a little aside.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You see this——’ He hesitated for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>word, and then said, ‘young lady; you will
take her away at once. There is not a
moment to be lost. Get her out of the house
directly. I am going for a doctor. The Professor
is seriously ill. Do you understand?
You are to lose no time. You must take her
away at once.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Denis stared at him in the appallingly nonunderstanding
way that belongs, I believe,
to Irish servants alone. It doesn’t mean
that they don’t understand; it only means
that they are taking it all in, with a cleverness
that few other servants can show at a
moment’s notice.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘An’ where, yer honour?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Anywhere out of this!’</p>

<p class='c004'>This struck him as abominably unfeeling,
and he added hastily: ‘To the safest place
you know—the very safest. I depend upon
you, Denis. Treat her as you would your
own daughter.’</p>

      <div class='line'>‘For the shades are about us that hover</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When darkness is half withdrawn,</div>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The doctors when they came could do nothing
for him. The Professor, though hardly an
old man as the ordinary acceptation of the
word goes, being still within the seventies,
had so burnt out his candle at both ends that
all the science in Europe could not have kept
him alive for another twenty-four hours. A
spice of gruesome mirth seemed to fall into
the situation when their declaration was laid
bare and one thought of the great discovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham was the one who thought of it,
and a wild longing to rouse the old man, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>was now sunk into an oblivion that presaged
death, and compel him even in his death-throes
to reveal the secret that might bring
even him back to life, seized upon him. But
he felt it was impossible, and presently the
two great men went downstairs to consult
each other, and he was left alone with his
dying friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had hardly gone when, watching
as he incessantly did the face of the Professor,
he noticed a change. He bent over
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why doesn’t she speak now,’ said the
Professor. He was thinking of the girl’s
voice—a voice that had taken him back to
his early days in some strange way.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Master,’ said Wyndham—he, too, had
gone back to the old days—‘you are thinking——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of her. They said she was dead.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who was dead?’ asked Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this the old man roused. He had not
known Wyndham’s voice the first time, but
now he did, and he turned and looked at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>him; and presently consciousness once more
grew within his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is you, boy. And where is she?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She? The girl, you mean?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.... I promised her. You remember....
It is late now, very late&#160;...
and I must sleep. But&#160;... a word, boy....
I have left you all, and she&#160;... out of it&#160;...
you must give her&#160;... give her....’ He
sank back.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘All—all,’ said Wyndham eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No&#160;... no’—he rallied wonderfully—‘three
hundred a year—that for a girl....
The rest is yours.... But see to her....
I can trust you. You are a good boy. But
your Greek, boy—your Greek is bad—your
aorists are weak. You must mend—you
must mend....’</p>

<p class='c004'>His dying eyes tried to take the old stern
look as they rested on Wyndham, the look
he used to give the boy when his Greek or
his Latin verses were hardly up to the mark,
but presently it changed and softened into a
wider light. ‘The boy,’ in the last of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>moments, was forgotten for the love that
was strongest of all.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She was very like my wife,’ he gasped
faintly, and fell back and died.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c004'>It was all over. The doctors had taken
their departure, and the old dismal house
was very still. The Professor had died in
the morning, and it was quite night again
before Wyndham had time to think of
ordinary matters. It was the presence of
Denis, who had come up to see, probably,
how his master had continued to live so long
without him, that brought back the thought
of the girl to Wyndham’s mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Where did you take her?’ he asked listlessly.
Even as the words passed his lips
he knew it was most important that she
should be found again. She was now the
inheritress of three hundred a year—no mean
thing for a girl who only last night was
ready and willing to die of want, amongst
other things, no doubt.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>‘To the Cottage, sir.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To——’ Wyndham gazed at him as if
too astonished to give way to the words that
evidently lay very near to his tongue.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The Cottage, sir. Yer own place, sir.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The Cottage,’ repeated Wyndham, now
breaking forth in earnest. ‘What the devil
did you take her there for?’</p>

<p class='c004'>His extreme anger would have cowed
perhaps any other servant in Europe save
Denis. That good man stood to his guns
without a flinch.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Fegs, sir, ’tis you can answer that,’ said
he, with quite an encouraging air.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What d’ye mean, Denis?’ demanded
Wyndham almost violently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m manin’—what I’m manin’,’ said Denis,
who certainly was not violent at all. ‘Ye
know yourself, sir, that the first thing ye
said to me about the crathur was to take her
to the safest place ye knew.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well?’ said Wyndham, with anger he
tried hard to stifle.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Faix, yer honour, it seemed to me that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the safest place I knew for the young
lady was the house that belonged to yer
honour.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This no doubt was distinctly flattering, but
at the moment the flattery did not appeal to
Wyndham. The girl down there—and what
the deuce was he to do with her? And
what would all the people round be thinking?—for
the most part country folk. The
Cottage lay twenty miles outside Dublin.
The Rector, Mr. Barry, would for one be
positively enraged. He would require all
sorts of explanations.</p>

<p class='c004'>Denis had waited for a reply, but finding
none, now went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Anything wrong, sir?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Anything!’ said Wyndham. ‘Were you
mad that you should take a—a person like
that down to my house? A girl found lying
on the Professor’s doorstep! Good heavens,
man! what could you mean by it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>He exaggerated a little when he said ‘my
house.’ As a fact, he lived very little in the
Cottage, only using it when he felt tired and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>overdone by work. His real home was to be
found in rooms in Dublin—pleasant rooms in
Upper Merrion Street. There he entertained
his bachelor friends, and was highly regarded
by his landlady. He was one of those men—more
usual than the coming young lady believes—who
thought a great deal more of
their work, and their reading, and their golf,
than of the opposite sex.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, sir, there’s this,’ said Denis, who
had remained beautifully calm. ‘Besides
tellin’ me I was to take her to a safe place,
ye specially said as she was to be thrated as
me own daughter. I remimber the words
well. Now, ye know well, sir, havin’ bin
intimate with me an’ Bridget since ye wur
in yer first throusers, that we haven’t a child
between us; an’ yet for all that I tuck it for
manin’ that the young lady was to be given
to Bridget.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You took a great deal upon yourself then,’
said Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Maybe so,’ said Denis, pursing up his
lips. ‘But ye said as how she was to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>thrated like that; an’ if a girl was my
daughter—why, I’d take her to Bridget.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It was impossible to go into this involved
affair. Wyndham dismissed him with a
gesture; but Denis dallied at the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose there’s something wrong, sir?’
persisted he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nothing,’ said Wyndham, putting a
match to his cigar, ‘except that you are the
most infernal ass I ever met.’</p>

<p class='c004'>With a heavy heart Wyndham, assisted
by a physician of great note, had gone
through the Professor’s papers. There were
few of them, and with regard to the experiment
only a few useless notes here and
there, principally written on the backs of
envelopes. There was nothing connected—nothing
that could be used. The Professor,
it seemed, had been in the habit of writing
on his brain, and on that only. Alas! there
was nothing left wherewith to carry on the
great discovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham abandoned his search with a
sigh. There was no doubt now that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>wonderful experiment was lost to all time.
With this sad ending of it he told himself
he had closed one chapter in his life, but he
made a mistake there; the chapter was only
beginning.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>‘No!’ says Susan. The word is not a denial;
it is merely an ejaculative expression of the
most extreme astonishment, largely mingled
with disbelief.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun is glinting through the trees in
the old orchard right down on her head,
striking a light from the glancing knitting-needles
she has now let fall into her lap.
This old orchard is the happy hunting-ground
of the Barry children old and young—the
place which they rush to in their joyous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>moments, the place which they crawl to with
their griefs and woes. To-day neither joys
nor griefs are near them, and it is out of
sheer love alone for its mossy old apple-trees
and its sunlit corners that Susan had tripped
in here a while ago with a dilapidated old
novel tucked into her apron pocket, and the
eternal sock with the heel half turned
between her pretty fingers. After her had
straggled Betty, a slender creature of sixteen,
and Tom, the baby. Tom was five, but he
was always the baby, there having been no
more babies after him, principally because his
mother died when he was born. And last of
all came Bonnie, the little cripple, hopping
sadly on his crutches, until Susan saw him,
and ran back to him and caught him in her
arms, and placed him beside her on the warm
soft grass, putting out her much-washed
cotton skirt that he might sit upon it, and so
be protected from even an imaginary damp,
and had cuddled him up to her, to the many
droppings of the stitches of the long-suffering
heel.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Carew, who came between Betty and Susan,
was away, fishing somewhere in the Crosby
river, and Jacky had not put in an appearance
since breakfast. How on earth his
lessons are going to be prepared between this—two
o’clock—and five, makes Susan wonder
anxiously. Why doesn’t he come home?
What can he be doing?</p>

<p class='c004'>She has hardly got further than this in her
thoughts of the truant, when suddenly he
appears upon the scene, a very rosy, bright-eyed
rascal, big with news. Indeed, it was
the coming of Jacky, and the astounding
revelation in his opening sentence—that he
had sprung upon them in a most unprincipled
way, without a word of warning—that had
drawn from Susan that heavily emphasized
‘No!’</p>

<p class='c004'>She speaks again now.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t believe it,’ she says.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Susan, why not?’ asks Betty, who is
sitting with her hands folded behind her
head, perhaps because if she brought them
forward she might find some knitting to do,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>too. Idle hands they are, only made for
mischief; so is the face to which they belong.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Because it’s nonsense,’ says Susan, shrugging
her shoulders, and drawing Bonnie closer
to her. ‘And, besides, I don’t want to believe
it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I do!’ says Betty, with a little
grin from under her big sun-hat. ‘Go on,
Jacky.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I saw her, I saw her plain,’ says Jacky,
his rosy round face fired with joy at the
thought of being for once the bearer of
important news. ‘She was walking about
in the garden.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In,’ from Susan, in a severe tone, ‘Mr.
Wyndham’s garden?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, in there.’ Jacky now looks as though
he is going to burst. ‘Why don’t you believe
me? I saw her, I tell you. I saw her quite
plain. An’ her hair is dark, a lot darker than
yours, an she’s got a blue frock like your
Sunday one, only better.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan interrupts him with dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>‘I don’t see how Mrs. Denis’s——’ Denis’s
wife was always called Mrs. Denis; if she
had any other name, it was sunk beneath insuperable
barriers. Mr. and Mrs. Denis she
and her husband had been since the priest
poured his blessing down upon them and
made them one in the old chapel built on the
rock at the end of the village. This rock
gave the parish priest a distinct crow over
the Protestant clergyman.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ye would quote me the Scriptures, would
ye?’ Father McFane would call to Mr.
Barry as the latter drove by the chapel in
his Norwegian on his way to the church
beyond. ‘An’ what did St. Paul say?
“Like a house founded upon a rock.” Why,
here’s the rock, man. Come in! come in!
where are ye going?’</p>

<p class='c004'>It occurred every Sunday, and Mr. Barry
would smile back at Father McFane, and
nod his head, for the two, indeed, were great
friends, as the Protestants and Roman
Catholics often are in small places, until
someone comes in to them with wild news
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and absurd tidings from incendiaries outside
to upset the loving work of years.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t see how Mrs. Denis’s niece or
cousin, or whatever she is, should have a
better gown than mine,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But she isn’t Mrs. Denis’s cousin, she’s too
young,’ says Jacky. ‘She’s a girl, and she
was pulling the flowers like anything, and if
she belonged to Mrs. Denis she wouldn’t be
let do that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Jacky’s English is always horrible.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you’ve dreamt the whole thing!’
says Susan contemptuously. ‘Run away
and play.’ She has forgotten about the
lessons.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you are a marplot! I am going to
believe in Jacky for once in my life. Don’t
go, Jacky! Jacky, come back! If you
don’t, Aunt Jemima will make you do your
lessons.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This has a magical effect. Jacky swerves
round.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is there,’ says he indignantly. ‘I
did see her.’ He seems to dwell on this fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>with gusto. ‘An’ she’s not Mrs. Denis’s niece.
An’ old Meany down by the mill says she’s
been there for four weeks.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The plot is thickening,’ says Betty lazily.
‘’Tis a clever villain, whoever she is; fancy
her being here for four weeks without the
very size of her shoes being known throughout
the length and breadth of Curraghcloyne!
Four days ought to have done it. Go on,
Jacky! Had she a cloven foot by any
chance?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; but’—and Jacky’s eyes widen, and
he seems to swell—‘Meany says she’s a
prisoner.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A what?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, a real prisoner. She’s not let go out
of the place. Mrs. Denis never opens the
front-gate now, but comes out by the little
green one we can see from the hall-door, an’
even that’s locked when she comes out an’
goes back again, Meany says.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Denis very seldom comes out by any
other,’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But she doesn’t always lock it behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>her,’ puts in Betty, who is evidently beginning
to enjoy herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now she locks the front-gate too,’ says
Jacky triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s perfectly thrilling,’ declares Betty,
sitting up and growing openly interested.
Betty is frivolous. ‘A prisoner, and a young
girl. Can she be the long-lost princess of
our infancy? And imprisoned by Mr. Wyndham!
Oh, the terrible man!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is of course a friend of Mrs. Denis’s,’
says Susan, with the grand air of one who
will have the truth at any price, and who is
bent on dismissing all theories save the
practical one. ‘It’s the most natural thing
in the world. We all know Mr. Wyndham
told her he wouldn’t come down for a month
or two, and so she is entertaining a niece or
a cousin, or something.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She isn’t a niece of Mrs. Denis’s, any way,’
persists Jacky obstinately; ‘she’—with a
hopeful, yet doubtful glance at Betty, whose
latest idea has struck him—‘she is much more
like a—a princess.’ Again he looks at Betty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>as if expecting her to bring him through this
difficulty of her own making; but Betty fails
him, as she fails most people.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘After all, I dismiss the romantic element,’
says she, nursing her knees and swaying herself
indolently to and fro in the warm sunshine.
‘I incline now towards the supernatural.
Susan,’ addressing her elder sister
with due solemnity, ‘perhaps she is a ghost.’
Her face thus uplifted is sufficiently like
Susan’s to let all the world know they are of
kin; but Betty’s face, piquante, provocative,
as it is, lacks the charm of Susan’s. Betty
is pretty, nay, perhaps something more, for
the Barrys are a handsome race; but Susan—Susan
is lovely. It is useless saying her
nose is not pure Greek, that her mouth wants
this or that, that her forehead is a trifle too
low. Susan, when all is said, when long
argument has been used, remains what she
was before—lovely. The smiling, earnest
lips, the liquid eyes, the rippling, sunny hair—all
these might be another girl’s, but yet that
other girl would not be Susan. Oh, beauteous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Susan! with your youthful, starry eyes
and tender, mirthful, timid air, I would
that a brush, and not a pen, might paint
you!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A ghost! Nonsense,’ says she, now contemptuously.
‘But’—thoughtfully—‘what
a queer story!’ And again, with a wrathful
glance at Jacky: ‘After all, I don’t believe a
word of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I do! I want to,’ says Betty, who
revels in sensations. ‘And the ghost development
is beautiful. I’d rather see a ghost
than anything. As you looked, Jacky, did
she vanish into thin air?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; only round the corner,’ says Jacky
reluctantly. He would evidently have liked
the vanishing trick.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Very disappointing! But perhaps that’s
her way of doing it. Corners are always so
convenient.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If the gates are all locked,’ says Susan,
turning suddenly a magisterial eye upon her
brother, ‘may I ask how you saw her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, that’s part of it! That,’ says Betty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>‘is where the fire and brimstone come in.
That’s what makes her a ghost. It isn’t
everybody can see through stone walls,’ says
she, lowering her voice mysteriously, and
glancing at the staring Jacky. ‘She had
evidently the power to turn Mrs. Denis’s
walls into glass! It’s very unlucky, Jacky,
for ghosts to fall in love with people, and I’m
sorry to say I think this one has developed a
mad fancy for you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She hasn’t!’ says Jacky, who is now
extremely pale.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Circumstances point to it,’ says Betty,
who is nothing if not a tease. ‘And when
ghosts fall in love, they do dreadful things to
people. Things like this!’ She has risen, and
is now advancing on the stricken Jacky with
her slender arms uplifted, and long fingers
pointed downwards and arranged like claws.
She has taken to a sort of prance, a high-stepping
walk that brings her knees upwards
and her toes outward, and she has worked
her face out of all recognition in an abominable
grin. All this taken together proves too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>much for Jacky, who, his face now visibly
paler, descends precipitately upon Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan has been seeing to the comfort of
her little Bonnie, and has therefore been
ignorant of Betty’s flight of fancy until
the moment when Jacky stumbles somewhat
heavily against her, and looking up, she sees
Betty’s diabolical pose.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Betty, don’t!’ says she, glancing back to
Jacky’s face, which is, indeed, a mixture of
pluck and abject terror.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Would you not warn him, then?’ says
Betty reproachfully, returning, however, to
her ordinary appearance, and making an
aside at Bonnie, a pretence at shooting him
with her first finger and thumb, that sends
the delicate little creature into fits of laughter.
‘Poor old Jacky!’ returning to the charge.
‘It isn’t for nothing that ghosts reveal themselves.
It is easy to see that this one has
her eye on you!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She hasn’t,’ says Jacky again, who is on
the point of tears. He is evidently not
partial to ghosts. ‘And it wasn’t through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>glass wall I saw her—it was——’ He stops
dead short.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes?’ says Susan, still severely. ‘Do be
quiet, Betty, and let him speak. It was——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Through the hole in the wall near the
garden,’ confesses Jacky doggedly, but somewhat
shamefacedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You see, it was through the wall, after
all!’ says Betty, breaking into a delighted
laugh. ‘She’ll get you, Jacky—she’ll get
you yet.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think it is a very nice thing to
peep through other people’s walls into their
grounds,’ says Susan, more from the point of
view that she is the eldest sister, and bound
to say a word in season now and then, than
from any feeling of horror at the act. All
boys peep through holes in walls, when lucky
enough to find them. ‘How would you like
it,’ says she, ‘if you were found doing it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But I wasn’t found,’ retorts Jacky sulkily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ Betty breaks into the argument
with a vivacity all her own, ‘you have no
more morality than a cat. You are teaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>him all wrong. It isn’t the not being found
out, Jacky, that is of importance, as Susan
is most erroneously bent on impressing upon
you; it is the fact of peeping in itself that
makes you the’—shaking her finger at him—‘miserable
sinner that you are!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Sinner yourself!’ says Jacky, now driven
to desperation and the most unreserved impertinence.
‘I often saw you look through
the hole in the wall yourself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this, instead of being annoyed, both
Susan and Betty give way to inextinguishable
mirth; whereupon Jacky, who had, perhaps,
hoped that his shot would take effect,
prepares once more to march away. But
Betty, making a sudden grab at him, catches
him by his trousers.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Wait awhile,’ cries she, still shaking with
laughter. ‘Susan, seize his arm. Tell us
the rest of it. Was she——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I won’t tell you anything; and I’m sorry
I told you a word at all. Let me go, Betty.
D’ye hear? You are tearing my breeches.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And you are tearing our hearts,’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Betty, ‘Jacky darling. Go on; don’t be
a cross cat, now. Was she——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Twice as pretty as you, any way,’ says
Jacky, with virulence.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is that all? Poor girl! says Betty, who
is very hard to beat. ‘Prettier than Susan?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, lots.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She must be a real princess, then, and no
ghost. I’d like to leave a card upon her.
Perhaps you would kindly push it through
the hole in the wall, Jacky.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This is adding to the insult, and Jacky,
with the loss of a button or two, and serious
injury to his suspenders, breaks away.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There now!’ says he, beginning to cry.
‘Look what you’ve done; and no one to
mend it; and Aunt Maria will be angry,
and father will give me twenty lines——’
Sobs check his utterance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan rises hurriedly, and, with a whispered
word to Bonnie, she passes him on to Betty,
who, in spite of her carelessness, receives
the little fragile creature with loving arms,
hugging him to her, and beginning to ransack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>her memory for a story to tell him, such as
his soul loveth; then Susan, slipping her arm
round Jacky’s shoulder, whispers soft comforts
to him. He shall come in now and do his
lessons with her, so that father shall not be
vexed this evening, and after dinner (the
Rector’s family dined at two, and had high
tea at seven) she would take him with her
up to Crosby Park.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jacky’s recovery is swift; his sobs cease,
and he graciously allows himself to be kissed.
To go to Crosby Park is always a joy—the
big, huge, handsome place, with its long
gardens and glass houses, and, best of all,
its absentee landlord.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is, indeed, quite ten years since George
Crosby has been at the Park, and in all probability
ten more years are likely to elapse
before he comes again. The last accounts of
him were from Africa, where he had had a
most unpleasantly near interview with a lion,
but had got off with a whole skin and another
not quite so whole: the lion had come
to grief.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>‘Where there is mystery, it is generally supposed
that there must also be evil.’</p>

<p class='c010'>It is three o’clock as Susan, with Jacky in
tow, leaves the Rectory gate and goes up the
village towards the broad road beyond that
mounts steepwards to Crosby Park. Curraghcloyne
possesses but one street, and a
very small one, too; but as a set-off to that
it teems with interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>This morning a pig-fair was held in the
‘fair-field,’ a square mass of beaten earth,
anything but ‘fair,’ and as unlike a field as
possible; and now that the ‘payers of the
rint’ have been mercifully removed, bought,
or sold, the unsightly patch is covered by
young colts, that are being ridden up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>down by their owners, with a view to showing
them off; whilst in the far part of the
field, over there, cows, sheep, and donkeys
are changing owners.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here, in the main street, much lively conversation
is going on. On the right, Salter,
the hardware man—a virulent Methodist,
who calls himself a Protestant—is retailing
to a hushed and delighted group the very
latest ritualistic news of the curate just
lately imported, and who, if a most estimable
man, is undoubtedly abominably ugly.
Short and stout and ill-made, poor Mr. Haldane
has not proved a success amongst the
Protestants of the parish. His views are
extreme, and so are his looks, and, as Betty
most unkindly put it, he should, on his ordination,
have been at once despatched by the
Bishop of the diocese as a missionary to the
Cannibal Islands, with a view to getting rid
of him as quickly as possible. He is a sore
trial to Mr. Barry, the Rector of the parish,
and Susan’s father. But he had to replace
the last curate in a hurry, that young man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>having resigned his charge at a moment’s
notice, because the Rector would not give
his sanction to having matins at six a.m., he
said; but in reality because Susan had, the
evening before, rejected him with a haste
that deprived him of all hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just now the excitement amongst the
groups at Salter’s is growing intense. The
curate had been knocked down. No! But
he had fallen—and so on, and so on. A few
shops lower down comes Mr. Murphy, the
undertaker’s. He, too, as indeed do all the
shopkeepers in Curraghcloyne, stands in the
front of his shop-door, chatting to all who
come and go. A little, fat, jolly man, rather
useless you would think in a solemn business
like his, and yet the best undertaker, for all
that, in the seven parishes round. Perhaps
it is well to have a cheerful person of that
sort to dispel the dreadful gloom of death.
However it is, he is a universal favourite,
and no wonder, when I tell you he is the
man in all Curraghcloyne who can tell you
most about the babies!—the ones come, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>ones to come immediately, and those in the
middle distance! The gayest, happiest little
man in the town, with a wife as rosy as himself,
and quite a crowd of embryo little undertakers
swarming round his knees. But these,
and many more of the Curraghcloyne celebrities,
sink into insignificance before Ricketty,
the proprietor of the Crosby Arms Hotel.
This name is painted on a swinging signboard,
with a huge boar beneath, the crest
of the Crosbys from all time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ricketty—his name was once Richards,
but time and many devoted friendships has
brought it down to Ricketty—is a huge
benign Irishman, with the biggest jaw in
Europe and the smallest eyes. To his bones
flesh has grown, until now he might have
exhibited himself in the most fastidious show
in New York as the ‘Last of the race of
Anak,’ or some such attractive title.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as most big men are, so is he—the
mildest-mannered man on earth; who would
have run away if he had been asked to scuttle
a ship, and who would have fainted if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>idea of cutting the throat even of a mouse
had been suggested to him. One side of his
hotel has the usual bar blind up in it, behind
which is a parlour, where on special occasions
the politicians congregate to air their eloquence.
The other side is given up to a
fancy shop, kept by his sister, Miss Ricketty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Ricketty is the wit, and therefore the
scourge, of the village (very little wit suffices
for a village such as Curraghcloyne), and
though nearly stone-deaf, knows more of
the ‘goings on’ of her neighbours than anyone
else in the small town.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of course there is a bank and a post-office
in Curraghcloyne. And a town-hall, where
the future tenors and sopranos of the world
sometimes ‘kindly consent’ to sing to the
poor people round them. And there is the
draper’s shop called ‘The Emporium,’ very
justly, of course; and there is a market-place
too, where everyone says the beef and mutton
are both bad and dear. But even the interest
of all these fails before the caustic tongue of
Miss Ricketty.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Just as Susan reaches the window of the
hotel that holds Miss Ricketty’s show of notepaper,
ballads, bull’s-eyes, woollen mufflers,
the latest thing in veils ten years old, and
the flotsam and jetsam of various seasons
past, she finds herself face to face with
Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have come back!’ says she involuntarily.
She is glad to see him. He is—well,
scarcely an old friend, because the distances
between his comings and goings to
the Cottage make such broad margins on the
leaf of time that he has hardly come into
quite close contact with the family at the
Rectory. But they have known him for a
long time, and they have liked him, and
there is a good deal of soft, pleasurable
welcome in the glance that Susan gives him.
He has been away now, she tells herself, quite
two months.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Wyndham, smiling. His smile
is a little preoccupied, however. ‘And how
are you, Jacky? My goodness, how we are
grown! You’ll be as big as Ricketty presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>if you don’t put a weight on your
head.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Jacky sniggles, but, like Wyndham’s smile,
his sniggles are a little preoccupied. Having
shaken hands with the latter, he retires behind
Susan, and wonders if Wyndham is going up
to the Cottage, and if he is, will the ghost
catch him? He rather hopes it. It would
leave him—Jacky—free, any way, and Mr.
Wyndham is a big man and would be a
better match for her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan, too, is thinking of the ghost. As
Wyndham is facing now, the Cottage lies
before him. Is he going to see the mysterious
‘prisoner’? Perhaps he is married to her!
This seems delightful—like an old romance,
so much nicer than the commonplace marriages
of to-day. She scans Wyndham’s face
swiftly with a view to saying something nice
and kind to him, if she sees anything there
to help her to believe in this sentimental
marriage. But evidently she sees nothing,
because she says nothing. After all, she tells
herself, it is of course a secret.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>‘I hope you will come in and see father,’
she says presently, when she and Wyndham
have discussed the town and its inhabitants,
and she has told him all the news. He is in
the habit of sleeping at the Cottage whenever
he does come down, and in the habit, too, of
spending his evenings at the Rectory, which
is only just over the way from the Cottage.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not to-night, I’m afraid,’ says Wyndham.
‘I must go back to town by the evening
train.’</p>

<p class='c004'>A slight frown gathers on his brow, but he
dismisses it as he bids her good-bye.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Remember me to him,’ he says quickly,
absently. He pinches Jacky’s ear, and is gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan, who has been inveigled into a
promise concerning bull’s-eyes, is now led
triumphantly into Miss Ricketty’s shop, where
that spinster is discovered in an Old English
attitude, her body being screwed out of all
shape in her endeavour to catch sight of
someone going down the street. Her window
is quite blocked up by her shoulders, and her
deafness prevents her from knowing of Susan’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>coming until Jacky, falling over her left leg,
which is sticking out behind in mid air, brings
her back to the perpendicular and a view of
Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>She is a small woman, thin to a fault, and
shrewd-visaged, with a quizzical eye and a
bonnet. The latter is of the historic coal-scuttle
shape, and must have been a most
admirable purchase when bought—‘warranted
to wear,’ in the truest sense of the word, as
it has lasted without a break for at least fifty
years. As no one in Curraghcloyne ever saw
her ‘outside of it,’ and as she is popularly
supposed to sleep in it, it may safely be
regarded as a sound article; even her worst
enemy had once been heard to say that, ‘no
matther how great an ould fool she was wid
her tongue,’ she had made no mistake about
‘the bonnet.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘An’ is that you, Miss Susan, me dear?’
says she, when Jacky has picked himself up,
and she has ceased to rub her ankle. ‘Ye’re
as welcome as the flowers in May, though
divil a flower we had this year, wid the rain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>an’ all. Ye’re not in a hurry, miss, are ye,
now? Ye can spare a minute to the ould
maid? Come in, then.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She opens the little gate that hinges on to
her little counter, and draws Susan inside,
to her ‘parlour,’ as she calls the tiny space
within—a cosy spot in truth, where in the
winter a fire burns briskly, and with a wall
lined with bottles that make glad the souls
of children. To Susan Barry the old maid
has given all the heart that remains from her
worship of her giant brother. Perhaps it is
the almost childish sweetness of her manner
that has won the old maid’s heart, or else the
young unconscious beauty of her—beauty
being dear to the Irish heart. However it
is, she has a warm corner in Miss Ricketty’s.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘An’ how’s your good aunt?’ says the
spinster, adjusting the bonnet with one hand,
whilst with the other she pulls out from
under the counter a huge ear-trumpet, half
a yard long, and big enough at the speaking
end to engulf Susan’s small and shapely head.
‘She’s been expectin’ that clutch o’ eggs I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>promised her, no doubt; but them hens o’ mine
might as well be cocks for all the eggs we get
out of them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Aunt Jemima knows that eggs are scarce
now,’ cries Susan, softly, into the gulf.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Scarce! ’Tis nothin’ them ungrateful hens
is doin’ for us now, an’ we who coddled ’em
up all the winther. The saints forgive thim!
Miss Susan’—leaning towards the girl, and
speaking with the suppressed emotion of the
born gossip—‘was that Misther Wyndham as
wint up the street just now?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Susan. ‘I was talking to him
just before I came in here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No! Blessed Vargin!’ says Miss Ricketty,
recoiling; she had, of course, been the first
to hear of the mysterious stranger at the
Cottage, and had, indeed, told the news to
her brother, under promise of secrecy, that
she knew he would not keep. Nor did she
want him to keep it. How can you gossip
unless you have someone to gossip with?
That is why people spread scandals.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And what was he saying?’ asks she presently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>when she has produced a little box of
figs and given them to Jacky, with a view to
keeping him quiet until she has got the last
word of news out of Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nothing, I think,’ says Susan, running
over mentally her late conversation with
Wyndham. ‘He won’t have time to see
father to-night, because he is going back to
town by the evening train.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is that what he says?’ Miss Ricketty
gives her bonnet a push. ‘Faith, he’s full of
smartness. An’ did he tell ye nothin’ at all?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, it was I who told him everything,’
says Susan. ‘He wanted to know how the
new curate was going on, for one thing,
and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If ’twas Misther Haldane he was askin’
afther so kindly, I could a’ tould him somethin’,’
says Miss Ricketty. ‘But never mind
him! What else was Misther Wyndham
sayin’?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There was not time to say anything,’ says
Susan, laughing. ‘He was in a hurry, and
so was I—at least, Jacky was; he wants you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>to give him two pennyworth of bull’s-eyes.
Though, really, after those figs——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Miss Susan’—the old maid puts Susan’s
last remark aside with an eloquent gesture—‘have
ye heard anything sthrange about the
Cottage lately?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan starts, and Jacky comes to a dead
set, the last fig between his finger and thumb.
Jacky must be far gone indeed when, having
anything edible between his fingers, he delays
about putting it between his lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ye have, I see,’ says Miss Ricketty. ‘I’m
tould, me dear,’ looking behind her, and
beside her, and to the door, and now, for
even better security, putting up her opened
palm to one side of her mouth, ‘that there’s
a young—a’—she hesitates as if to choose
a word, then comes to a safe conclusion—‘a
faymale there,’ she says.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There’s a girl there, I think,’ says Susan
nervously. ‘At least’—here Jacky looks at
her appealingly, and she changes her sentence—‘someone
says there is. A niece, or a friend
of Mrs. Denis’s, I suppose.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>‘Arrah! Suppose!’ says Miss Ricketty
with considerable eloquence, but without
committing herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, if not that,’ says Susan, who is full
of her late romantic idea about a secret marriage
between the unknown and Wyndham,
‘perhaps—perhaps Mr. Wyndham knows
something about her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Ricketty turns sharply, and looks at
her. But the girl’s lovely, open, tranquil
face betrays nothing but a soft enthusiasm.
A sense of amusement fills Miss Ricketty’s
breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Fegs, I’m thinkin’ ye’re on the right
thrack,’ says she evenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You won’t say it again, Miss Ricketty,
will you?’ says Susan; ‘but I have thought—at
least, it has occurred to me—that perhaps
she’s Mr. Wyndham’s wife.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a little too much for Miss Ricketty.
She gives way suddenly to a fit of coughing,
and, turning her back to Susan, dives under
the counter, whether to recover from a very
proper confusion, or to indulge in very improper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>laughter, can now, alas! never be
known. When she emerges, however, her
face is a fine crimson.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That would be very romantic, wouldn’t
it?’ says Susan, looking at her and speaking
softly, yet with a pretty delight. ‘A marriage
like that, with nobody knowing anything
except they two, you know; and I
feel sure she is lovely, and Mr. Wyndham
is very nice-looking too, and after awhile
perhaps we shall know her. He will introduce
us to her, and we shall be friends,
and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘’Tis a beautiful story,’ says Miss Ricketty,
breaking in with unction. ‘An’ beautiful
stories, we all know, come thrue. I wish ye
joy o’ the bride at the Cottage, Miss Susan;
but I wouldn’t be for intherferin’ wid the
young married people too soon if I were you,
me dear.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course, I shouldn’t do that,’ says Susan
hastily, her fair face growing earnest. ‘But
I thought that if——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, ye’d betther wait, I think,’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Miss Ricketty. ‘’Tis bad bein’ in a hurry,
as Misther Haldane found out last night.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Haldane! What has happened to
him?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Fegs, miss, it seems that last night, as he
was descendin’ the steps from the vesthry,
he thripped, God help us! an’ fell on his ugly
mug an’ broke his front teeth.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, how dreadful!’ says Susan, real compassion
in her tone, though the new curate
is rather farther beyond the range of her
sympathy than even the old. ‘I wonder
father hasn’t heard of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It seems the poor gintleman is keeping it
dark,’ says Miss Ricketty, ‘wid the thought
of gettin’ thim put in agin widout anyone
knowin’. But’—wrathfully—‘’twill be no
use for him. I see that villain of a Salter
down there’—with a glance out of the window—‘tellin’
every wan of it. Why, ye must
have seen him yerself, miss, as ye come by.’
And suddenly Susan does remember the crowd
round Salter’s shop-door, with Salter himself
in its midst. ‘He’s got hould of it, for sure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>and if he has ’twill be short shrift for Misther
Haldane.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But why?’ asks Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, this, miss!  He hates your clergy
because he’s not in wid ye, like. A Methody
he is; an’ Mr. Haldane goes agin his grain,
wid the candles an’ the flowers an’ that, an’
he says how that Mr. Haldane had a dhrop
too much last night when he thripped on the
vesthry stairs.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What a shame!’ says Susan indignantly.
‘I know for a fact that Mr. Haldane is——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, of course, miss. But that’s how thim
Methodys does. An’ as for that Salter himself,
I don’t believe in him. ’Tis a power o’
whisky he can get undher his own belt widout
bein’ found out, until his timper is up. I
know for a fact that ’twas only a week ago
that he bate his poor wife until she let a
screech out of her that would have waked
Father D’Arcy himself, only that the seven
sleepers aren’t a patch on him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It appears she cannot even spare her parish
priest! Susan, who has risen, and who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>now dragging Jacky from under the counter,
where he has been in hot pursuit of a kitten,
bids her old friend good-bye for the present.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You’ll tell Miss Barry about the clutch,’
says the spinster; and  ‘Yes!’ shouts Susan
into the terminus, a little louder than usual,
perhaps, because Miss Ricketty lifts up her
hand and shakes it at her reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Wan would think I was deaf,’ says she
tragically, whereupon both she and Susan
laugh together. The girl’s happy mirth—seen
if not heard—delights the old maid
behind the counter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye, me dear, an’ God bless you!’
says she, and, disdaining to even see Susan’s
pennies, she thrusts a big parcel of sweets
into Jacky’s small hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Keep a few for Masther Bonnie,’ whispers
she, as she kisses him and sends him after
his sister.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the door, however, Susan turns back,
and once more calls down the trumpet:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You will contradict that thing about Mr.
Haldane, won’t you?’ says she; ‘surely it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>bad enough that he should have lost his
front teeth, without having scandalous stories
spread about him. Besides, they will make
father very unhappy.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll look afther him,’ says Miss Ricketty,
‘if only to oblige ye, me dear; though, I
think, I’m not wantin’. Providence seems to
have his eye on that young man.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, poor man!  I’m afraid not,’ says Susan;
‘he was ugly enough before, and now his
front teeth are gone!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s it,’ says Miss Ricketty; ‘whin next
ye look at him, ye’ll see what a fine openin’
the Lord has made for him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The last vision Susan has of Miss Ricketty
shows her leaning back in her chair, with her
apron over her bonnet, convulsed with joy at
her own wit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>‘Nature often enshrines gallant and noble hearts in
weak bosoms—oftenest, God bless her! in female
breasts.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Quite close to the gardens Susan meets one
of the under-gardeners at Crosby Park.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose Master Jacky and I can go in
and see the gardens, Brown?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes, miss, o’ course. But I’m afraid
there’s no one there. As it happens, no one’s
working there to-day. ’Tis a holiday, you
know, miss. An’ the gates are locked.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It happens, indeed, to be a saint’s day, or
holiday—one of the innumerable saints’ days
that are held sacred in Ireland, and on which
no man will work, if he is a Roman Catholic
labourer, though the loss of the day’s hire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>is a severe strain upon his slender resources.
And the funny part of this arrangement is
that, though they are too religious to support
their families by working on these days, they
never know what saint’s day it is, or anything
in the world about him—or her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh!’ says Susan; she had forgotten
about its being a holiday, though both the
maids had gone to chapel in the morning,
leaving her and Betty to make up the many
beds. Her tone is so disappointed that
Brown drags out a key from his trousers
pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If ye’ll take this, miss, ye can let yoself
in, an’ ye can lave it at the lodge wid Mrs.
Donovan whin ye’re goin’ back.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, thank you, Brown!’ says Susan joyfully;
and diving into her pocket, she produces
twopence (it is quite a sum for Susan,
whose pennies are very scarce), and gives it
to him, an instinct born with her—a sort of
pride—compelling her to reward the underling.
And yet she had refused to give
Tommy—the baby, the youngest of all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and the dearest to her of the children after
Bonnie—a halfpenny out of that twopence
only this morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thank you, miss,’ says Brown, with considerably
more gratitude than he would have
shown another if she had given him half a
crown, and Susan, who had paid for the key
quite as much for her own sake as for Jacky’s,
goes on her way rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yes, the gate is locked. Susan, having
unlocked it, carefully removes the key, locks
it on the other side, and goes down the broad,
beautiful, scented path with Jacky beside her.
Some of the houses are near, but not so
worthy of notice as those that come after,
and through these they hurry to the great
glass ones beyond—where the roses are all
a-growing, all a-blowing, in magnificent profusion—that
are always kept up in a very
perfect state, though the master of them
be in the Soudan or North America, or
among the highest peaks of the Andes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Between these two sets of houses runs a
wall, now laden with cherry-trees in full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>fruit, and as Susan and her brother emerge
from the seedling-house into the freer air,
she catches sight of something that brings
her to a standstill.</p>

<p class='c004'>Against the wall where the cherries are
growing stands a ladder, and on the top of it—a
man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, Susan knows all the gardeners at
Crosby Park, and even those beneath them,
and certainly this man is not one of
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>She turns and retreats on Jacky, who is
just behind her, and for a moment fear covers
her. She has never been brought face to
face with a thief before—few girls have
been—and a desire to fly is the thought
uppermost in her breast. She glances upward
fearfully to the figure on the top of
the wall, who is hastily pulling off the
cherries and dropping them into the basket
he has slung on to the top of the ladder.
She draws her breath quickly. Could anything
be more premeditated—could anything
show more plainly what a determined rogue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>he is? And to-day of all days! A holiday,
when, of course, he knew that all the gardeners
would be away, and the place safe to
him! No doubt he had climbed the outside
wall—thieves can do anything—and had
found the ladder inside with which to rob
poor Mr. Crosby, who is now goodness
knows how many miles away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan stands rooted to the ground, not
knowing whether to stay or fly. Old stories
of heroines return to her, and it seems to her
that it would be base to steal away now and
say nothing; even if she happened to gain
the walk outside, it is doubtful whether she
should meet any servant, this being a saint’s
day; and if she did, would he be willing
to tackle a real live thief single-handed?
As she hesitates, she again looks at the man,
and notices that he is glancing from right to
left, hesitating, as if either uneasy or else
with a view to choosing the best fruit. Both
ideas anger her, but the second more than
the first. Uneasy? of course he is! And
no wonder, too! A thief must necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>be uneasy. And to attempt to steal here, in
this lovely secluded place!</p>

<p class='c004'>The owner of Crosby Park has been so
long away that Susan has almost adopted
his place as her own. Many years ago Mr.
Crosby, who had been a pupil of Mr. Barry’s,
had given directions that every member of
the Barry family should have free right to
his grounds, and Susan, once come to years
of discretion—not so long ago—has taken
great advantage of this kindly permission.
It is so near to the Vicarage, and so lovely!
All its walks and pretty windings are so well
known to her. They have been much to her,
indeed, during all these years, though so little
to the actual possessor of them, who has
evidently found more pleasure in shooting
grizzlies than in cultivating cherries.</p>

<p class='c004'>That now someone has come to steal these
cherries seems dreadful to Susan. With that
poor man away, too—at the end of the world
probably, shooting, or being shot by, some of
those awful Indians! Again she casts her
frightened glance at the thief, still high on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>his ladder and secure from detection now
that all the servants are away; and something
in his air—an insolent security, perhaps—drives her to action.</p>

<p class='c004'>No, she will not fly! She will tell him, at
all events, what she thinks of him before
flying. She makes her way straight to the
foot of the ladder, wrath in her bosom, and
addresses him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wonder you aren’t ashamed of yourself!’
cries she, righteous indignation in her tones
and in her lovely uplifted eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sweet voice rings up the ladder. The
start that the thief on the top of it gives,
when he hears her, condemns him to all
eternity in Susan’s eyes. ‘No one,’ argues
Susan to herself, ‘ever starts unless he is
guilty.’ Susan is very young.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man casts a sidelong glance at her.
It is so one-sided that Susan hardly sees
him, but evidently he is trembling, conscience-stricken,
because he makes no reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Come down!’ says Susan again, her
courage mounting with the occasion. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>tone is now severely calm, and without a
vestige of fear. After all,  he is a poor
creature whom even a girl can frighten, so
small is the courage of the unrighteous!
‘Do you know what you are doing? You’—with
accumulated scorn—‘are stealing!’</p>

<p class='c004'>This terrible charge brings the culprit
round. He sinks upon the topmost rung
of the ladder, as if overcome, and pulls his
cap over his eyes, evidently to avoid recognition.
Says Susan to herself:  ‘He is
ashamed, poor creature!’  and seeing the
abject attitude of the wretch, she grows
bolder, and presses the wondering Jacky to
her side, and tells him to take courage. This
poor man will not kill them. No—no, indeed.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, stealing,’ repeats she, her fair, beautiful
face uplifted to the sinner’s above her.
There is a second pause, during which, perhaps,
the sinner takes note of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I——’ begins he, then pauses. Susan’s
eyes are looking into his, and Susan’s face,
implacable and austere, no doubt has daunted
him. But Susan tells herself that conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>guilt has rendered him silent. After awhile,
however, he makes another attempt.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I——’ says he again, and again stops.
It is contemptible! Susan turns a scornful
glance upon him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is not to be defended,’ says she. ‘To
steal from a garden like this! From a garden
that the owner has so kindly left open to
many people—who has besides been so kind,
and who has helped all the poor in the
district. He has given forty blankets where
another has given ten, and coals without restriction
everywhere. And these beautiful
gardens, too—he has given these as a recreation
to some who have no lovely gardens of
their own; and now you take advantage of a
day like this, when all the servants are away,
to defraud this kind, kind man and steal his
cherries. Oh, how can you bear to be so bad?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you would hear me!’ begins the man
on the top of the ladder, in a low tone. He
is evidently immensely touched by the scorn
of the young evangelist below, because his
voice is very low and uncertain.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>‘There is nothing to be said,’ says Susan,
her eyes gleaming with honest disgust.
‘There is no excuse for you. You are here
stealing Mr. Crosby’s cherries, and, as I said
before, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still, miss, if you would listen a moment!’
He has pulled his cap even closer over his
brows.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You needn’t do that,’ says Susan. ‘Poor
creature! you need not be afraid of me; I
will not give you up to justice!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thank you kindly, miss,’ comes from the
wretched creature behind the cap. He is
evidently struggling with emotion.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t want you to thank me,’ says Susan,
who is feeling inclined to cry. She has often
read of thieves, but never met one until now,
and it seems to her, all at once, that they are
decidedly interesting, so ready to hear—to
receive admonition, too. ‘I want you to
promise me that for the future you will
abstain from—from thieving of any sort.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll promise you, miss—I will indeed. I’d
promise you anything.’ Poor thing! he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>seems quite overcome. ‘But, miss, I wasn’t
really stealing just now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, nonsense!’ says Susan; a revulsion of
feeling makes her once again hard to him.
Confession is good for the soul, but denial—and
such a useless denial, too, caught in the
act as he is—savours of folly, that worst of
all things, for which there is no forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you think I did not see you? Why,
look at that basket; it is nearly full. How
can you say you were not stealing those
cherries? Better to show some regret than
to carry off your crime in such a barefaced
way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is hardly barefaced, the unhappy culprit’s
face being now quite hidden by his cap.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Just think,’ says Susan, her clear, sweet
voice trembling with grief because of this
sinner; ‘if you had a garden, would you like
people to come into it and steal your fruit?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The poor thief is evidently beginning to
feel the situation acutely. He has taken out
his handkerchief in a surreptitious fashion,
and is rubbing his eyes with it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>‘I shouldn’t mind if it was you, miss,’ says
he, in a stifled tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Poor thing! he is evidently very sorry.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You won’t give me up, miss?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no!’ cries Susan hastily. ‘But I do
hope you see and are grieved for what you
are doing. When people are so good and so
generous as to let other people go through
their grounds and get a great deal of enjoyment
out of them, I think the least those
others may do is to respect them, and their
shrubs, and fruit, and flowers.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You’re right, miss. I seem as if I never
saw it like that till now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah! that’s what they all say,’ says Susan
sadly, and with a sigh. She has a good deal
to do with her father’s impenitent penitents.
‘But you are no doubt from some distant
parish. A tramp, I suppose,’ says Susan,
with another sigh. ‘At all events, I am
sure you do not belong to this part of the
world, as your voice is strange to me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ve come a long way, miss, indeed.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Poor man! Perhaps you are hungry,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>says Susan. Again she searches her pocket,
and produces the last coin in it—the last coin
she has in the world, for the matter of that—and
lays a sixpenny bit on the lowest rung
of the ladder.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Perhaps this may help you,’ says she.
‘I’m sorry I haven’t any more, but I haven’t.
And now remember I expect you to keep
your promise. I shall not report you, or get
you into trouble of any sort; in fact, this’—gently—‘shall
be a secret between you and
me; but I do expect you to go away without
those cherries, and with the promise
never to steal again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I promise you that, miss, most gratefully.
I’ll never steal again. But, miss, might I
give the cherries to you or the young gentleman?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no!’ says Susan in horror. She catches
Jacky’s hand and draws him away from temptation.
After going a yard or two, however,
she looks back; and the thief, who has been
looking after her, again pulls his cap hurriedly
over his guilty face.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>‘The gate is locked,’ says she; ‘how will
you get out?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The way I came, miss,’ says the bad man,
with open signs of contrition.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I see—yes,’ says Susan sadly. ‘But go
at once. I trust you—remember.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll never forget it, miss,’ says the unhappy
man, sinking down upon the ladder and covering
his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Jacky,’ says Susan, when they have left
the garden and locked the door carefully
behind them, ‘if you ever say a word about
that poor creature, I’ll never think the same
of you again. Do you hear? He is a wretched
thief; but I have given my word not to
betray him, and you must give your word
too. Poor man! I think he was sincerely
sorry. You won’t say a word at home or
anywhere, Jacky?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Jacky. He looks at her. ‘Why
couldn’t you have taken the cherries?’ says
he.</p>

<p class='c004'>It takes the entire remainder of the walk
home to make the ‘why’ clear to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wyndham, when he met Susan, had been in
rather a disgusted mood. Shortly after the
Professor’s death he had gone to Norway
for a month with the friend whom he had
arranged to go with on the morning following
the luckless night that had seen the last of
the Professor’s experiment. He had induced
his friend to wait for him—the latter consenting
with rather a bad grace—until the
Professor’s funeral was over and his affairs
looked into. He had had a last conversation
with Denis about the uninvited guest whom
the latter had taken to the Cottage, and had
told him to find a suitable home for her at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>once, comfortable—luxurious even, if necessary,
as she was now undoubtedly the possessor
of three hundred a year—but, at all
events, to get her out of the Cottage without
further delay. He spoke peremptorily,
and Denis promised all things; yet only
yesterday, on his return, he had heard from
Denis’s own lips that still that girl was
located in the Cottage.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Didn’t I tell you to get her a home somewhere
else?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ye did, sir—ye did. Faix, I don’t wondher
ye’re mad, but ‘twasn’t aisy to do it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To do what?’—firmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To get her to go.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What nonsense! A girl like that—as if
she could resist! Why, one would think there
wasn’t a policeman anywhere. Do you mean
to tell me she refused to go?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, sir; that’s not me manin’. ’Tis that
ould fool of a wife o’ mine. It seems she got
set upon her wan way or another, an’ do all
I could I couldn’t git her to turn the young
lady out. “There’s room for us all here,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>says Bridget. “But that’s not his ordhers,”
says I—manin’ you, sir. “But whin is she
to go?” says she. “That’s nothing to me,”
says I. “’Tis so,” says she. “A comfortable
home he tould ye to git for her, and where’ll
she find wan but here?” An’ divil a fut I
could move her from that. Don’t you iver
get married, Misther Paul; it will be the
undoin’ o’ ye. Ye won’t have a mind o’ yer
own in six months.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ve a mind now, any way,’ says Wyndham,
still swearing, ‘and that is to get rid of you
without another second’s notice.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘An’ I’m not surprised, sir,’ says Denis,
drawing himself up and saluting. He is
an old soldier. ‘It was most flagrant disobadience.
But what can ye do wid a woman,
sir? Fegs, nothing—nothing at all. They
carries all before thim—even a man’s conscience.
When Bridget refused to let her
go, what could I do?’ He pauses satisfied,
having put the blame upon his particular
Eve. ‘Is it yer wish that I tackle Bridget
agin, sir?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>‘No; I shall go down to Curraghcloyne
myself to-morrow,’ says Wyndham, getting
rid of him with a gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had gone down, had met Susan, had
read something in her face that seemed to
him (whose senses were very much alive to
impressions on the subject) to be studying
him—wondering at him. It was with a still
more enraged feeling he left her, and went
on to the Cottage, where, to his supreme
indignation, he found, for the first time on
record, the entrance-gate locked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Good heavens! What could be the meaning
of this? Were they determined to compromise
him in the eyes of the world? When
he has rung the bell until it is hopelessly
smashed, someone comes to the gate, and
without opening it says, in a voice evidently
meant to alarm any unwelcome intruder:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who’s there?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Only the master of this place,’ says Wyndham
grimly, who has recognised Mrs. Denis’s
handsome brogue even under these new conditions.
Indeed, it would be hard to mistake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>it anywhere; as Fitzgerald, who knows her,
says, ‘you could sit on it at any moment
without the slightest chance of a breakdown.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Glory be!’ comes in a muffled tone from
Mrs. Denis, and, with tremendous fuss and
flurry, she draws the bolt, unlocks the gate,
and opens it wide to Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, yer honour, who’d a’ thought to see
yerself this day! Faix, I thought ’twas still
in thim haythin countries ye were. Sure, if
I’d known I’d have had the gates open to
yer honour; and I hope ye’ll forgive me cap,
sir—I’ve another wan just ironed, an’——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you preparing for a siege?’ demands
Wyndham grimly; ‘or what may be the
reason of this “barring out” on your part?
Anything threatening on the part of the
Land Leaguers or the Home Rulers round
here?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, law, sir! How could ye think o’ sich
a thing? It was only that the young lady,
sir, was a trifle nervous.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She will have to take her nerves somewhere
else,’ says the barrister. ‘Now, Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Denis, I hear from your husband that it is
your fault that this—this distinctly undesirable
person is still a resident in my house.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Denis, who has been bowing and
scraping up to this, now grows suddenly
alert.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Arrah, what are ye sayin’ at all?’ says
she. ‘D’ye mane to tell me that Denis knew
ye were come back, and niver give me tale
or todin’s of it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is altogether beside the question.
The thing is——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Faix, the raal thing is this,’ says Mrs.
Denis, ‘that I’ll break ivery bone in that
thraitor’s skin the next time I see him!
Why,’ says she, squaring her arms and growing
so wrathful that the questionable cap on
the top of her head begins to quiver, ‘sixpence
would have brought any boy down
from Dublin wid the news of yer return,
and’—with a truly noble declaration of an
innate dishonesty—‘I could thin have’—she
stops herself, happily, at the last moment—‘made
mesilf clane to meet ye,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Wyndham, who is sufficiently Irish himself
to put in the broken paragraph, smiles coldly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am not going to discuss Denis with you,’
says he. ‘What I want to know is why
these gates are locked.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, sir, there was this: when the young
lady came she was that upset wid bad thratement
of wan sort or another that she seemed
to be tremblin’ all over. But whin I questioned
her as to what ailed her, not a word
could I git out of her. I put her to bed, an’
she just clung to the wall like, turnin’ an’
twistin’ her purty head, an’ always keepin’
away from me, an’ refusin’ the tay even, till
the night came down upon us. Ye will remimber,
sir, that it was in the airly mornin’
that Denis——’ At this word she breaks off,
and grows again intensely angry.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That varmint,’ says she, ‘what did he
mane by not tellin’ me? Wait till I get
me hands on him!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, the early morning,’ says Wyndham,
bringing her back somewhat impatiently to
the place where she had broken off.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>‘Well, yes, sir. I beg yer pardon. She
come in the airly mornin, an’ I could see at
once that she was very sad at her heart, an’
so I just tuk her in as I tell ye, for Denis,
though a divil all out in most ways’—here
again a most ominous frown settles on her
forehead—‘is still a man to be depended on
where a woman is concerned. And so I tuk
her in to oblige ye, sir.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To oblige me!’ says Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, sir, I thought so thin. An’’—she
pauses, and looks straight at him—‘an’ ye’ll
nivver regret it, sir. If ye saw her a bit
afther she came, an’ her delight at yer purty
place! “Why, there’s flowers growin’,” she’d
say, as if she never see them before, except
whin sellin’! “And, Mrs. Denis,” says she,
“I like these walls,” says she. “They is so
high,” says she. “An’ it would be very hard
for anyone,” says she, “to git through thim,
or even to look over thim.” Faith, ’tis little
the crayture knows of the boys round here,
I said to meself whin she said that. But I
declare to ye, sir, it went to me heart whin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>she said it, for it made it plain to me like
that there was someone in her life that she
was thinkin’ of, that she didn’t want to get
through these walls or over thim aither. If
he did, I could gather from what she said
that it would be wid no good intintions
towards herself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Has she said anything as to where she
came from or who she is?’ asks Wyndham,
with most disgraceful want of sympathy for
this moving story.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, sir, sorra a word, barrin’ that she was
very unhappy until yer honour sint her here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Till I sent her here! What on earth
do you mean?’ says Wyndham indignantly.
‘You must know very well that it was that
blundering idiot of a husband of yours that
brought her here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Fegs, ’tis plain that ye know Denis, any
way,’ says Denis’s wife complacently. ‘Idjit
is the word for him, sure enough! But however
it is, sir, the poor young lady is very
continted here entirely, an’’—waxing enthusiastic—‘’twould
do your heart good to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>hear her singin’ about the garden, for all the
world like wan o’ thim nate little thrushes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This expectation on Mrs. Denis’s part, that
he will find delight in the thought of the
unwelcome stranger making herself at home
in his garden and singing there like a ‘nate
little thrush,’ naturally adds fuel to the fire
that already is burning vigorously in Wyndham’s
breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Look here,’ says he, so fiercely that Mrs.
Denis starts backwards, ‘you’ve taken a
wrong impression of me altogether, if you
think I shall for one moment sanction the
presence of that girl here. Your husband
has got me into this mess with his confounded
stupidity, but I can trust myself to
get out of it—and I expect you to understand
at once that your “thrush”’—scornfully—‘will
be out of this within twenty-four
hours.’</p>

<p class='c004'>With this he brushes by her, his temper—never
very sweet—now considerably the
worse for wear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nice situation, by Jove! If it comes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the old man’s ears there will be the devil to
pay; and it’s sure to. He had felt there was
something queer in his aunt’s and Josephine’s
manner yesterday when he called at their
house in Fitzwilliam Square. Why, if it
gets about, there isn’t one in forty amongst
his acquaintances who will believe in the
real facts of the case.... It is a most
confounded affair altogether. If he hadn’t
gone abroad, trusting—like the fool that he
was—in Denis’s ability to get her out of the
Cottage at once, he could have done it himself,
and so speedily that no one would ever
have been the wiser about it. But now it
has gone a little too far; people, no doubt,
are beginning to talk. Well, it shall go
no farther. He will put an end to it at once—this
moment.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘My heart is sad and heavy,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In this merry month of May,</div>
      <div class='line'>As I stand beneath the lime-tree</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On the bastion old and gray.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>‘This moment’ has come. As Mrs. Denis,
routed, but by no means vanquished, disappears
hastily round one corner of the
pretty cottage, someone else comes round
the other. A young girl, singing sweetly,
merrily, though in a subdued voice. Just
as she reaches her corner she looks behind
her; her singing ceases, and an amused look
brightens her face—a face that has known
much sadness. Again she looks behind her,
as if expecting something, this time turning
her back on Wyndham; and now, a moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>later, a huge dog tears across the grass and
literally flings himself upon the girl, whose
tall but slender frame seems to give way
beneath his canine embraces. For a second
only; then she recovers herself, her pliant
body sways forward, and, catching the dog’s
handsome head in her arms, a merry tussle
ensues between them. It is almost a dance,
so agile is the girl, so bent is the dog on
entering into the spirit of the fun with all
his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham, watching, feels no sense of
amusement. Indignation is still full upon
him, and now it grows more intense as he
sees the dog—his dog—a brute hitherto
devoted to himself, lavishing its affection
upon an utter stranger.</p>

<p class='c004'>He makes an impatient movement, which
the dog’s quick eye sees, and, bolting from his
late companion, he comes bounding towards
Wyndham, from whom, it must be confessed,
he gets but a poor welcome.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl, turning, surprised at the dog’s
desertion of her, becomes suddenly aware
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>that there is someone beyond, and as Wyndham
emerges into sight she makes a movement
to fly, then stands stricken, as if turned to
stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is impossible, under the circumstances,
but that she should be known to Wyndham;
but as he looks at her he tells himself that, if
he had not known that Denis had brought
her down here on the morning of the Professor’s
death, he would never have recognised
her. Her dress, for one thing, is so different.
Of course he had found time to send a cheque
to Mrs. Moriarty before going abroad for the
use of the ‘waif,’ as he had somehow called
the girl to himself, not knowing her name—a
sum handsome enough to dress her as the
young heiress of a most unexpected three
hundred a year should be dressed—and it
comes to him now that the ‘waif’ had not
been slow in the spending of it. No doubt
Mrs. Moriarty had been the ‘middle man,’
but the ‘waif’ had known what she was
about, or else some well-born instinct had
directed her.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>‘Well born!’ Pah! A poor, miserable
girl like that, with a shawl thrown over her
head when first he saw her—and yet, her
face, her feet——</p>

<p class='c004'>He can see them from beneath her petticoats.
They are not like mice, by any means,
but they are of the proportions usually
assigned to those who have many grandfathers,
and they are very delicately clad.</p>

<p class='c004'>If he had not recognised her at all at first,
she had barely recognised him. That was
because of the surprise—the shock, perhaps.
She had almost come to believe in the possibility
of living here always and alone, never
seeing anyone except kind Mrs. Moriarty and
Nero, the dog.</p>

<p class='c004'>She has turned as white as death; and
Wyndham, looking at her, tells himself it is
the memory of that last dreadful night, when
she had accepted death as her portion, rather
than the life that lies behind her, that has
blanched her cheeks and brought that terror
into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>But in a minute all these theories of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>clever barrister are distilled and float into
air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having seen him, and dwelt upon his face,
the colour in her own face has crept back,
and with a sharp sigh of relief she draws
nearer to him slowly, the dog, who has gone
back to her, following, his muzzle in her hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I—I thought you were a stranger,’ says
she faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is an odd sentence. A stranger! What
else is he to her? Her manner, however,
makes it clear to him that she has lived,
since her entrance into the Cottage, in constant
dread of being discovered by someone,
and of being dragged back to a former
existence—to which death, as she had proved
to him that night, seems far preferable.</p>

<p class='c004'>This accounts for the locked gates, and the
girl’s admiration for the walls—an admiration
that no doubt has but little to do with the
ivy and the Virginian creeper, now throwing
out its palest leaves of green, and the other
trailing glories that have lifted them into a
dream of beauty.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>‘Your thought was very nearly right,’ says
Wyndham, with a cold smile; he is quite
unmoved by the nervous pallor and the
frightened expression on the young face
before him. Barristers after a while get
accustomed to young, frightened faces, and
lose their interest in them. ‘But, no doubt,
you remember me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>He pauses, and the girl looks at him for a
moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says she slowly, her eye sinking to
the ground. That last dreadful scene, in
which he had played so conspicuous a part,
and when in the sullenness of her despair she
had welcomed death, lies once again clear as
a picture to her eyes. She shudders, and a
faint moisture breaks out upon her forehead.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am glad to see you quite recovered,’
says he in a tone which belies his words.
‘If you will be so good as to come indoors,
I should like to speak to you for a few
minutes about your future.’</p>

<p class='c004'>His tone is so curt, so positively unpleasant,
that the girl, colouring deeply and without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>another word, moves towards the hall-door
of the charming cottage, and leads the way
through the porch—so exquisitely festooned
with delicate greeneries—into the long many-windowed
room beyond. This room runs the
entire length of the house, and overlooks the
garden. As she goes a deep melancholy falls
upon her. What has he come to say? Why
is his manner so unkind? That night—that
awful night—he had seemed to befriend her—to
take her part—and now——</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are of course aware,’ says Wyndham
formally, when they have reached the
drawing-room—the drawing-room that used
to be his, but that now seems to slip out of
his possession, as he sees the slender figure
of the girl turn after his entrance, as if to
receive him. ‘You are of course aware that
the late Professor, Mr. Hennessy, left you
three hundred a year?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl, standing midway between one of
the windows and Wyndham, makes a slight
affirmative movement of her head. She
would have spoken, but words failed her.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>‘That was in accordance with his promise
to you. If the experiment failed, well’—with
a careless shrug—‘there was nothing.
If it was successful—you were to be the
gainer by it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>His voice is clear, unemotional; there is a
sort of ‘laying down the law’ about it that
takes every spark of sympathy that there
might have been quite out of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’ This time she manages to speak,
but she colours as she speaks, and blushes
very painfully; and now her eyes seek the
ground. If one were to exactly describe her,
one would say—but very reluctantly, I think—that
she looks ashamed.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘With three hundred a year you should be
able to——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She interrupts him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is too much—far too much,’ says she,
with an effort. ‘I don’t want so much as
that. Fifty pounds a year would be enough;
I am sure I could——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She stops.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘All that is beyond question,’ says the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>barrister coldly. ‘It was the Professor’s
wish that you should have three hundred a
year, and now that he is gone, there can be
no further argument about it. He has no
near relations so far as I can make out, so
that there is no reason why you should not
accept the money left to you by him. What
I came to-day for was, not about the Professor’s
gift to you, but to know what you
intend to do with it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘With it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; what, in fact, are you going to do?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What am I going to do?’ She looks up
at him for the first time; a startled expression
grows in her large dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We all have a future before us,’ says
Wyndham, ‘and you——’ He hesitates here,
hardly knowing how to go on with those
earnest eyes on his. ‘Of course I feel that,
for the time being, I am in a sense bound to
look after you, the Professor being an old
friend of mine, and you——’ Again he stops.
It seems impossible, indeed, to refer to that
strange scene where he had had so prominent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>a part. ‘You will understand,’ says he, ‘that
the Professor wished you to be placed in an
assured position, and he left me to see to
that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the girl makes a sharp movement of
her hands descriptive of fear.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Naturally,’ says Wyndham, in answer to
that swift movement of the pretty hands,
‘you object to my interference. But I must
ask your forbearance in a matter that’—with
a steady look at her—‘does not concern me
in the slightest degree. You must really
forgive me if I seem impatient; but, as you
are aware, I know nothing about you, and to
look after you as the Professor asked me
to do requires thought. I am in complete
ignorance about you. I can see that you are
educated, but beyond that I know nothing.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah! you know nothing indeed,’ says she
quickly. ‘I am not educated. I know hardly
anything. I am one of the most ignorant
people alive.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And yet——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have read anything I could find to read,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>interrupts she; ‘and at one time I went to a
day-school, but that is all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I see,’ says Wyndham. His tone is indifferent,
but, inwardly, curiosity is stirring
him. So little education, and yet so calm,
so refined a manner! Who is this girl, with
her well-bred air, but with, too, the little
touches here and there that betray the fact
of her having lived not only out of the
fashionable world, but very far from even
the outskirts of it? What whim of fate
has given her that shapely head, those shell-like
ears and pointed fingers, yet given her
into the clutches of the middle classes?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You would wish to enlarge your studies?’
asks he presently.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the first time since she came towards
him, in the garden outside, she now lets her
eyes rest frankly upon his.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, if I could!’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is very easily to be managed, I should
think. You have three hundred a year of
your own, and can command advantages that
hitherto, I imagine, from what you say, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>been withheld from you.’ He waits a moment,
as if expecting her to speak, to make some
comment on his words, but she remains mute.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you could tell me something of yourself—your
history—what brought you to
this,’ says Wyndham, ‘it might make matters
simpler for both you and me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl shrinks backwards as though he
had struck her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no!’ cries she quickly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

      <div class='line'>‘I wept in my dream, for I fancied</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That you had forsaken me;</div>
      <div class='line'>I woke, and all night I lay weeping</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Till morning, bitterly.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Wyndham lifts his brows.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Pray do not distress yourself,’ says he.
‘It is a free country; you can speak or be
silent, just as you wish. It had merely
occurred to me that there might be friends
of yours naturally very anxious about you,
and that I might convey to them a message
from you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The unsympathetic nature of his tone has
restored the girl to her usual manner more
than anything else could have done. She
glances at him.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>‘Friends!’ says she bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘At all events,’ says Wyndham, who has
now begun to acknowledge his curiosity with
regard to her even to himself, and is determined
on pushing the matter as far as possible,
‘there must be someone on the look-out
for you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this she turns as white as death.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is there? Have you seen—have you’—she
looks as though she is about to faint—‘heard
anything?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nothing—nothing at all!’ exclaims he
quickly, a little shocked at her agitation, that
seems excessive. ‘Do not be frightened; I
assure you I know as little of anyone connected
with you as I know of yourself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here again he gives her an opening, if she
wishes to make a declaration of any sort, and
again she remains mute. There is something
even obstinately silent in her whole air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her hands in her lap are tightly clasped,
as though to help her to keep her secret to
all eternity.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You will not confide in me, I see,’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>he, with a little contemptuous shrug; ‘and,
after all, there is no earthly reason why you
should. I am as great a stranger to you as
you are to me, and if I spoke at all it was,
believe me, because I fancied I might be of
some assistance to you. But women nowadays
have taken the reins into their own
hands, and I have no doubt that you will be
able to manage your own affairs to perfection.
In the meantime, however, if I can be
of the slightest use to you in looking out for a
suitable home, for instance, I hope you understand
I shall be delighted to do all I can.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl has drawn nearer during this
speech, and is now standing before him, the
frightened eyes uplifted and her breath coming
short and fast. ‘You mean—but here—can
I not—might I not—a home, you said——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, yes,’ says Wyndham. ‘A home
where you might have a companion and be
very comfortable; but not here, you know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You can’t stay here, I’m afraid,’ says
Wyndham, who, between his anger and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>suspicions of her, is beginning to wish he had
never been born.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl turns away from him, in so far
that only her profile now can be seen, whilst
her right hand has caught hold of the back
of a chair near her, as if for support.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But why?’ asks she, in a low tone. ‘Mrs.
Moriarty likes me to be here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, you see,’ says Wyndham gravely, ‘it
is my house, and not Mrs. Moriarty’s.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’ She looks at him as if hardly understanding,
but presently an expression grows
upon her face that gives him to know that
she thinks him churlish.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is quite a big house,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a pause—a pause in which he tells
himself that evidently up to this she had been
accustomed to houses of very cramped limits.
The Circular Road in Dublin would supply
such houses, built for respectable artisans and
clerks in commercial places, and the best of
the decent strata that cover the earth and
are of the earth earthy. The Circular Road,
or some other road, has no doubt supplied the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>kind of house to which the girl has been
accustomed—this girl, with her pale patrician
face and her singular strength of mind. It
is she who at last breaks the silence. ‘There
is plenty of room for me,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know—of course I know that,’ says
Wyndham hurriedly. ‘But then, you see,
it—it wouldn’t do, you see.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He looks deliberately at her, as if to explain
his meaning, but, nothing coming of
the look, he falls back once more upon facts.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I come here sometimes,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; Mrs. Denis told me that,’ says the
girl. ‘But’—eagerly—‘I shouldn’t be in the
way at all. I could stay in that little room
belonging to Mrs. Denis—that little room off
the kitchen.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, that isn’t it,’ says Wyndham, frowning
in his embarrassment. How the deuce
is one to say it plainly to a girl who can’t,
or won’t, or doesn’t understand! ‘The fact
is——’ He has begun with the greatest
bravery, determined to explain the situation
at all hazards; but, happening to meet her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>eyes, this clever barrister, who has faced many
a barefaced criminal victoriously, breaks down.
The eyes he has looked into are full of tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Look here,’ says he almost savagely, ‘it’s
out of the question! Do you hear?’ His
tone is so terribly abrupt that it strikes
cold to the heart of the poor girl looking at
him. If he is going to turn her out of this
house, this haven of refuge, where—where
can she go?</p>

<p class='c004'>She struggles with herself, some touch of
dignity that belongs to her—wherever she
came from or whoever she is—giving her a
certain strength.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course—I see——’ She is beginning
to stammer dreadfully. ‘I am sorry about
it; but I thought—I fancied I could stay
here. But now I can go—I can go somewhere.
There must be other places, and,
indeed, just now you told me there were
other places, and that I could go to——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She struggles with the word ‘them,’ the
last of her sad sentence, but can’t speak it;
and now all her hard-found dignity gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>way, to her everlasting shame, and to Wyndham’s
terrible discomfiture she bursts into a
passion of tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t do that,’ says Wyndham gruffly.
It is impossible to conceal from himself the
fact that he is frightened out of his life.
Fear because of her tears is nothing, but it
is with ever-increasing self-contempt that he
knows that he is going even so far as to give
in and let her stay at the Cottage. After
all, there are many other places for him in
this big world, but for her, perhaps, not so
many; and she seems to have set her heart
on this little spot, and, hang it all! why
can’t she stop crying?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I’m sorry,’ says she at last, trying
passionately to stifle her sobs. She has
turned away from him to the window, and
there is something in her whole attitude so
descriptive of despair, and fear, and shame,
that, in spite of his anger, pity for her rises
in his heart. ‘I don’t know why I’m crying;
I don’t often cry. But if I leave this, where
shall I go? where shall I hide myself?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>What on earth has she done? Her words
denote fear—a guilty fear. What if he
should be about to take as a tenant for the
Cottage a well known and hardened criminal,
for whom, perhaps, the police are even now
on the look-out? Her face, however, belies
her tone; and, for the rest, he has not the
courage to face again a flow of those pitiful
tears. Stay she must.</p>

<p class='c004'>One last protest, however, he makes as a
salve to his conscience.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What do you see in this place that so
attracts you?’ asks he, with ever-increasing
grumpiness. The girl turns to him a flushed
and tearful face.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I never knew what a home could be like
till I came here,’ says she. ‘Never, never!
You have had one—all the world has had one
except me. It means new life to me. Oh’—bitterly—‘it
is the only life I have ever
known—the only happiness. If, sir’—she
comes towards him and with a little impulsive
action holds out her hands—‘if I
might stay——’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>‘Well, you can,’ says he ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c004'>He gives in so suddenly, and she is naturally
so unprepared for so quick a surrender, that
for a moment she says nothing. Her eyes
are fixed on him, however, as if trying to
read him through; they are beautiful eyes,
and Wyndham, his professional instincts on
the alert, finds himself wondering what lies
behind them in that brain of hers.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you mean it?’ says she at last breathlessly;
if you do, I cannot thank you enough.
Oh, to stay here within these lovely walls!’
Instinctively she glances out of the window
to the ivy-clad walls, as if in their protection
she finds great comfort. A moment later a
cloud gathers on her forehead. ‘But you
don’t like me to stay,’ she says.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It doesn’t matter what I like,’ says
Wyndham, who certainly does not shine on
this occasion. ‘The arrangement we have
come to now is that you are to rent this
cottage from me, at what sum we can agree
about later on.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To rent it? I shall, then, be—— It’—
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>she tries to hide the joy in her eyes, feeling
it to be indecent—‘it will belong to me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Wyndham. At this moment
he feels very little more will make him
positively hate her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It will no longer be yours?’ Her voice is
trembling.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In a sense, no.’ He turns and takes up
his hat; this interview is getting too much
for him. There will be an explosion shortly
if she goes on like this.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It seems very selfish,’ says the girl. She
is looking at him, though for the last three
minutes he has refused to look at her. ‘I
am taking your house away from you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There are other houses.’ He is now
putting on his gloves.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah! that is as true for me as for
you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We have come to an agreement, I think’—grimly.
‘Let us keep to it.’ He turns to
the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are going?’ says she nervously.
She follows him. ‘You——’ She stops,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and courtesy compels him to look back.
Two troubled eyes meet his.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘When——’ stammers she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall come down some day next week
to make final arrangements,’ says he impatiently,
and again takes a step or two
away, getting so far this time as to turn the
handle of the door.  Here, however, again he
glances back. She is standing where he last
saw her, her young face looking troubled,
frightened, and uncertain.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Next week,’ repeats he jerkily. It is
disagreeable to him to think that it is
through his fault that the nervous anxiety
has crept into her eyes. ‘And—er—good-bye.’
He certainly had not meant to do it,
but he now holds out his hand to her, and
with a little swift, eager movement she
comes to him and slips her own into it.</p>

<p class='c004'>A slim little hand, and beautifully shaped,
but brown, and looking a little as though it
had done some hard work in its time, yet
the grace with which she gives it to him is
exquisite.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Just at the gate he meets Mrs. Denis again.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘This young lady,’ says he abruptly,
‘seems to have set her heart upon living
here. It is extremely unpleasant for me,
but she appears to have no other place to go
to. She will therefore become my tenant.
She will, you understand, take the Cottage
from me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Bless us an’ save us!’ says Mrs. Denis.
‘An’ yer honour—what will you do?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Keep out of it,’ says Wyndham coldly.
‘I suppose she will arrange to keep you on.
She——What’s her name?’—sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know, sir; she don’t seem to like
to spake about it. Miss Ella I calls her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ella? Did you say her Christian name
was Ella?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah!’—thoughtfully. ‘Well, good-bye.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, sir, you’ll be coming again?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, next week, to arrange about the
rent; not after that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He strides through the gate and up the
road.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>‘Faix, and I’m thinkin’ ye will,’ says Mrs.
Denis, watching him with her arms akimbo
till he disappears round the corner. ‘’Tis
mighty purty eyes she’s got in that mighty
purty head of hers. An’ so he’s not goin’ to
turn her out, after all! Didn’t I tell you,
Bridget Moriarty,’ rubbing her chin, on
which a very handsome beard is growing,
‘that he’d soften whin he put his glance
upon her?’</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>‘Where’s our beloved auntie?’ asks Mr.
Fitzgerald, looking generally round him from
his seat on the tail of Betty’s gown.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is the evening of the same day, and still
divinely warm. Not yet has night made its
first approach, and from bush to bush the
birds are calling, as if in haste to get as much
merriment out of the departing day as time
will give them. From here—in the bushes
round the tennis-ground, the one solitary
court that Carew Barry and his cousin, Dom
Fitzgerald, have made with their own hands,
after a hard tussle with the Rector for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>bit of ground, that seemed to him quite a big
slice off his glebe—to the big syringa-tree
beyond, the sweet, glad music of the birds
swells and grows, filling the evening air with
delicate throbbings. Ever the little creatures
seem to call one to another; passionately
sometimes, as if bursting their little throats
in their wild joy, and anon softly, pleadingly,
but always calling, calling, calling.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the old-fashioned garden beyond
comes the scent of the roses—all old-world
roses, as befits the garden, but none the less
beautiful for that. The rose céleste and the
white rose unique, the cabbage rose and the
perfect rose of a hundred leaves, all lend
their sweetness to the air; indeed, on this
June evening the place is ‘on fire with roses.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The little group sitting on the edge of the
tennis-ground seems very happy and contented—lazy,
perhaps, is a better word.
Susan, as usual, has Bonnie in her lap, and
Tom, the baby, has fallen asleep with his
head on Betty’s knee. Jacky, still full of
memories of the awful burglar he had interviewed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>in the morning, is wondering whether
he will raid the village to-night, and if so,
whether he will carry off Aunt Jemima;
whilst Carew, the eldest son, who is seventeen,
and therefore a year younger than Susan,
is lazily dwelling on the best choice of a
stream for to-morrow’s fishing.</p>

<p class='c004'>His cousin, Dom Fitzgerald, is the first to
break the lovely spell of silence that has
fallen on them. He is a cousin of the
Barrys, and a nephew of their father and
of Miss Jemima Barry also, the Rector’s
sister, who, since the death of her sister-in-law,
has always lived with them, and who, if
a most exemplary person, is certainly what
is commonly described as ‘trying.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The parish of Curraghcloyne is small, the
income even smaller. But if Providence, in
giving Mr. Barry this parish as his special
charge, had been niggardly to him in money
matters, it had certainly made up to him
lavishly in another respect—it had given
him, for example, a large, and what promised
to be an ever-increasing, family, so increasing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>indeed, that it would ultimately have beaten
the record but for the untimely death of
Mrs. Barry, who had faded out of life at
Tom’s birth. She was then just thirty-two,
but she looked forty.</p>

<p class='c004'>To her husband, however, gazing at her
dead face, surrounded by its lilies and white
roses, she looked seventeen again—the age at
which he had married her—and though he
was a man entirely wrapped up in his books
and theories, it is an almost certain thing
that he never forgot her, and that he
mourned and lamented for her as few men
whose lives are set in smoother places do for
their beloved.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Barry, his sister, came on the death
of his wife and took possession of the house,
Susan being then just thirteen. She had but
a bare sum wherewith to clothe and keep
herself, and was therefore of little use in
helping the household where money was
concerned; and it was therefore with a
sense of thankfulness that the Rector four
years ago accepted the charge of Dominick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Fitzgerald, an orphan, and the son of a
stepbrother of his wife.</p>

<p class='c004'>The poor, pretty wife was then a year
dead, but he knew all about Dominick’s
people. The Rector himself came of a good
old Irish family, and his wife had been even
more highly connected. Indeed, the lad who
came to Mr. Barry four years ago, though he
had inherited little from his father, would in
all probability succeed to his uncle’s title and
five or six thousand a year—a small thing
for a baronet, but, still, worth having. Of
course, there was always a chance that the
uncle, a middle-aged man, might marry,
though he was consumptive and generally
an invalid; but all that lay in the future,
and at present it was decided that the boy
should be given a profession; but having
proved remarkably idle and wild at school—though
nothing disgraceful was ever laid to
his charge—his uncle in one of his intervals
of good health had desired that he should be
sent down to Mr. Barry, for whom Sir Spencer
Fitzgerald had an immense respect and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>little fear, for a few reasons that need not
be specified, though, if Sir Spencer only knew
it, the Rector was the last man in the world
to betray the secrets of anyone.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rector accepted the charge gladly.
He had passed several young men (who had
been private pupils of his before his marriage)
very successfully for the Civil Service, and
he was doing his best for Dominick now,
whom from the very first he liked, in spite of
the reputation for idleness that came with
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Indeed, Dom Fitzgerald had fallen into the
family circle as though it had been made
for him, and had grown to be quite a brother
to his new-found cousins. He at once grew
fond of Susan, and became on the spot a
chum of Carew’s, who was reading with his
father for the army and expected to pass
next year. And he quarrelled all day long
with Betty, who accepted him as a ‘pal’
from the moment of his appearing. Betty
inclined towards slang.</p>

<p class='c004'>As for the children, they all loved him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and, indeed, it must be said that he loved
them, and spent a considerable amount of the
fifty pounds allowed him for yearly pocket-money
upon them.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, where is she?’ persists he, turning
a lazy eye from one to another, at last resting
it on Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She has gone down to Father Murphy’s
about Jane,’ says Susan reluctantly. ‘You
know Jane is always breaking everything,
and to-day she broke that old cup of our great-grandmother’s,
and Aunt Jemima was very
angry. She has gone to tell Father Murphy
about it, and to say she will never take a
Roman Catholic servant again unless he
punishes Jane severely.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And Father Murphy will laugh,’ says
Carew, with a shrug. ‘He knows she must
take Catholic servants or do without them.
All the Protestant girls of that class here are
farmers’ daughters, and either won’t go into
service at all, or else only to Lady O’Donovan’s
or the O’Connors’.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you should have heard Jane!’ cries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Betty, going off into one of her peals of
laughter. ‘When Aunt Jemima had reduced
her to a rage, she came in weeping to me.
All the forlorn hopes fall back upon me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘True, even this poor old forlorn one,’ says
Dom promptly, seizing his opportunity to
lift his head from her gown to drop it upon
her lap.</p>

<p class='c004'>After which there is a scuffle.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, never mind Dom!’ says Susan impatiently.
‘What did Jane say to you
about the cup?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She said——Go away, Dom.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m sure she didn’t,’ says Dom, with an
aggrieved air. ‘It’s an aspersion on my
character, Susan. You don’t believe this, do
you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She said,’ goes on Betty, very properly
taking no notice of the interruption: ‘“Law,
Miss Betty, miss, did ye iver hear the like o’
that? Did ye iver hear such a row about
nothin’?”’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘“It wasn’t about nothing,” I said; “because
you know how even father valued that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>cup, though an uglier thing I never saw in
my life.”’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘“Fegs, I don’t know what ye call anythin’,”
said Jane (she was crying all the time;
you know how she can roar); “but yer aunt
herself tould me that that cup is a hundhred
years ould if a day, an’ wid that to make sich
a screech over it! Faix, it must have bin
rotten wid age, miss; an’ no wondher it
come to bits in me hands.”’</p>

<p class='c004'>They are all delighted with the story.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think Aunt Jemima would have
been so cross with poor Jane,’ says Susan, in
a low tone and with a glance round her to
make sure of no one’s being within hearing,
‘but for those eggs this morning.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The eggs under the speckled hen?’ asks
Jacky; ‘I heard her speaking about them.
Won’t they come out?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan shakes her head, and Carew and
Dominick edge a little out of sight. The
latter, under a pretence of feeling too warm,
hides his face under the big straw hat that
Betty has thrown upon the grass beside her.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>‘They should have come out ten days ago,’
says Susan; ‘but they’—she casts an uncertain
glance at Carew, who has turned over
and is now lying with his face upon his arms,
and is evidently developing ague-fever—‘but
they didn’t.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Were they all addled?’ asks Jacky, with
amazement.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; they were all boiled,’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Boiled!’ says little Bonnie, sitting up with
an effort. ‘Who boiled them—the hen?’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this there is a stifled roar from under
Betty’s hat, whereupon the owner of it lifts
it and discovers Mr. Fitzgerald plainly on the
point of apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Just the sort of thing one would expect
from you,’ says she scornfully. ‘No wonder
you want to hide your face; but you shan’t
do it under my hat, anyhow.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Carew, think of that poor hen waiting
and waiting for three weeks, and then for
ten days more; I call it horrid,’ says Susan.
‘I really think you ought to be ashamed of
yourselves, you two.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>‘Ought we? Then we will be,’ says Dom;
‘never shall it be said that I shirked my
duty, at all events. Carew, get out of that,
and be ashamed of yourself instantly.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, that’s all very fine,’ says Betty, ‘trying
to get out of it like that; but let me tell
you that I think——’</p>

<p class='c004'>However, what Betty may think of people
who put boiled eggs under sitting hens is
for ever lost to posterity, because at this
moment Jane, with red eyes and a depressed
demeanour, comes hurrying up to them across
the small lawn, a covered basket in her hand.</p>

    <div>‘O, coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>‘For you, miss,’ says she, handing the basket
to Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan turns crimson. That basket! She
knows it well.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For me?’ stammers she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, miss.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who’—nervously—‘who brought it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A boy, miss.’ For an instant Susan’s
heart feels relief, but for an instant only.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Whose boy?’ falters she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know, miss. He came an’ wint
in a flash like. I hope, miss, as there isn’t
anythin’ desthructive in it,’ says Jane, whose
misfortunes of the morning have raised in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>her a pessimistic spirit.  ‘They do say thim
moonlighters are goin’ about agin.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you mean to say the—the messenger
said nothing?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, miss, except that it was for you.
That was all, miss; and I’m not deaf, though
I wish I was before I heard all that was
said to me this mornin’ about an ould cup
that——’ Here she lifts her apron and sniffs
vigorously behind it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, it can’t be for me,’ says Susan, with
decision; ‘take it away, Jane. There has
been some mistake, of course. Take it away
at once. Do you hear? The—the boy will
probably call for it again in a little time.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think he will, miss; he looked
like a runaway,’ says Jane.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good heavens! how interesting,’ says Mr.
Fitzgerald, breaking at last into the charmed
silence that has held them all since the advent
of Jane and the mysterious basket. ‘Who
can this unknown admirer be? No doubt it
contains roses’—staring at the basket—‘or
heliotropes—heliotrope in the language of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>flowers means devotion! Susan, are you
above a peep?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I am,’ says Susan hastily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am not,’ says Betty, springing forward
and pulling open the cover. ‘Oh, I say,
cherries! and such beauties, too! Susan,
you are in luck!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And so are we,’ says Fitzgerald, putting
a hand lightly over her shoulder and drawing
up a bunch of the pretty fruit between his
fingers.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I think we ought not to eat them—I
do indeed,’ says Susan, in a small agony.
There can be no doubt now about the fact
that the thief, repentant and struck to the
very soul by her eloquent pleadings, had
sought to redeem himself in her eyes by
sending the stolen cherries to her. Whether
with a view of giving her the pleasure of
eating them, or with the higher desire of
proving to her that he hadn’t devoured them,
must, she feels and hopes (because to meet
him again would be very unpleasant to her),
for ever remain unknown.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>‘Poor fellow!’ thinks she, regarding the
cherries with mixed emotions that are not
altogether devoid of admiration for her own
hitherto unimagined powers of persuasion;
‘he was certainly and sincerely penitent.
One could see that.’ She feels quite an uplifting
of her soul. Perhaps, who knows? she
has been born as a worthy successor to Mrs.
Fry, or some of those good people! But
then, after all, it is, undoubtedly, to Mr.
Crosby he should have made restitution, not
to her. It is, however, difficult to restore
Irish cherries—a rather perishable commodity—to
an owner who happens to be
at the moment in the middle of Africa, or
America, or China, for all she knows.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not eat them!’ says Betty indignantly.
‘Why, what else are you going to do with
them—make them into jam?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘They are not mine—I’m sure they are not
mine,’ says Susan. ‘Who, for instance, could
have sent them?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Jacky makes a movement.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Jacky, you know nothing!’ cries Susan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>turning indignant, warning eyes upon him;
whereupon Jacky, remembering his promise,
subsides once again into dismal silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Jacky, I smell a conspiracy,’ says Dominick,
who has caught the look between them;
‘and you are the head-centre. Speak, boy,
whilst yet there is time!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ve nothing to say,’ says Jacky sulkily;
he is naturally of a somewhat morose disposition,
and now feels positively ill at not
being able to divulge the delightful story of
which these glowing cherries are the result.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, I do believe you have at last got
an admirer,’ says Carew, in the complimentary
tone of the orthodox brother, who never can
understand why on earth any fellow can
admire his sister. ‘Come! out with it; he
seems a sensible fellow, any way. Flowers
are awful rot, but there’s something in
cherries.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Betty, when I fall in love with you I’ll
present you with a course of goodies,’ says
Dominick, regarding that damsel with an
encouraging eye.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>‘I have no admirers, as you all know,’
says Susan, her pale and lovely face a little
heightened in colour. She is thinking with
horror of what would have happened if that
poor awful thief had brought them in person.
But, of course, he was afraid.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Perhaps Lady Millbank sent them,’
suggests Betty, after a violent discussion
with Fitzgerald on the head of his last
remark. ‘I saw her in town yesterday.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So did I,’ says Carew. ‘Like a sack—not
tied in the middle.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan feels almost inclined in the emergencies
of the moment to say ‘Perhaps so,’
and let it stand at that, but conscience forbids
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She would have sent a footman and her
card,’ says she dejectedly. ‘No’—decidedly,
and preparing to close up the basket—‘they
are not meant for me, and even if they were,
I could not accept them, unless I knew where
they came from.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you mean that you are not going to
give us some?’ says Betty, rising, not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>figuratively, but actually, to the occasion, and
standing over Susan. ‘I never heard anything
so mean in all my life.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ says Fitzgerald mildly but firmly,
‘if you think to escape alive from this spot
with these cherries, let me at once warn you
of a sense of impending danger.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I say, Susan, don’t be a fool!’ says
Carew, turning his lazy length upon the
grass, a manœuvre that brings him much
closer to Susan and the cherries.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s a beastly shame!’ says Jacky, in a
growl. And at this little Tom, as if moved
to the very soul, or stomach, sets up a piteous
howl.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan, with all the ‘young martyr’ air
about her, looks sternly round. No; she
will not give in, and it’s perfectly disgusting
of them to think so much of eating things.
Her glance finishes at Jacky, who is scowling
and threatening her with the fellest of all
fell eyes, and then descends at last on Bonnie—Bonnie,
who is lying in her arms, his
pretty, thin, patient little face against her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>shoulder. Poor little Bonnie! darling little
Bonnie! who has said nothing—not a word—but
whose gentle eyes are now resting on
the fruit; Bonnie, whose appetite is always
miserable—so difficult to please. Susan, seeing
that silent, wistful glance, feels her heart
sink within her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Must she—must she deny him, her poor
little delicate boy, her best beloved of all
the many that she loves? Oh, she must!
she will be firm. These cherries really are
not hers. Even for Bonnie she——</p>

<p class='c004'>The child stirs in her arms and sighs, the
faintest, gentlest little sigh—only one who
loved him could have heard it; but with that
little sigh went out all Susan’s stern resolutions.
Almost unconsciously her hand goes
towards the basket that holds the cherries.
Slowly, slowly at first, as if held back; but
as it nears the glowing fruit it makes a rush,
as it were, dives into it, and in a second more
Bonnie’s thin little paws are filled with a
huge and crimson bunch of the sweet cherries.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alas for Susan’s principles! They have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>all vanished away like snow in the sun,
beneath two little pain-filled eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alas for Susan’s principles again! As
Bonnie’s white little face lights up as he
catches the pretty fruit, and bites one of
them in two with his sharp childish teeth,
and as after that he lifts the other half of it
to Susan’s mouth, and presses it against her
closed but smiling lips, she does not refuse
him. She opens her lips, and, against all her
beliefs, lets the stolen thing glide between
them. The happy laughter of the child as
she takes the fruit is nectar to her, and in a
little joyous way she hugs him to her, catching
him against her breast; and though she
does not know it, her one thought is this: ‘Let
all things go so long as this one is happy.’</p>

<p class='c004'>And certainly Bonnie for the moment is
happy with his cherries. But the cherry
he gave her is the first and only one out of
her basket that passes between her lips.
And that is self-denial, I can tell you from
experience, for a girl of eighteen.</p>

<p class='c004'>After this there is a general raid upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>basket, Betty and Fitzgerald being quite conspicuous
in their efforts to secure the largest
cherries, whilst Jacky runs them very hard.
And Susan, afraid lest the supply should fail
before Bonnie gets a handsome share, pulls
him to her and fills his little hands. But her
own hands? Never! Stern is her youthful
virtue. Those stolen cherries! No, no, she
could not touch them, and, besides, to watch
Bonnie’s delight in them is enough for her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bonnie! It seems such a sad critique upon
the little fragile child racked with rheumatism
and so sadly disabled by it.</p>

<p class='c004'>In happier days, when he was, in truth,
the bonniest little being of them all, his poor
mother—now mercifully in heaven—had
given him the dear pet name. And of
course it had clung to him through all the
ills that followed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The beginning was so simple, so easy to be
described. A wet day when the child had
escaped from home and had been forgotten
until the early dinner reminded them of him.
There were so many to remember, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>all ran so loosely here and there, that up to
that hour no one had missed him. His
mother was dead. The keynote of course
lay there. She was dead and lying in her
grave for a year or more, and the young
things who tried to take her place, when
they had asked a question or two, never
thought of Bonnie again. Carew, the eldest
boy, then only twelve, did not appear at
dinner either, and it was naturally and
carelessly supposed that Bonnie was with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alas for little Bonnie! Late that night
he was discovered and brought home, saturated
to the skin, and almost lifeless. Asleep
he had been found beneath the shade of a
big beech-tree; and sleep eternal he would
have known indeed had he not been discovered
before morning by the frightened
people from the Vicarage, who, when night
set in, had gone hunting for him far and
near. The Rector himself, roused from his
notes and papers by Susan’s terrors, had
joined in the search; but it was Susan who
found him, tired, exhausted (after a ramble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>in which he had lost himself, poor little soul!),
and wet through from the rain that had fallen
incessantly since three o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Susan who carried him home,
staggering sometimes beneath the weight,
but strong in the very misery of her fear.
When at last home was reached, it was
Susan who undressed him, and lay awake
the long night through with him, holding
him in her warm arms to heat his shivering
little body. And, indeed, when the morning
came he seemed nothing the worse for his
exposure.</p>

<p class='c004'>But towards the evening he began to
shiver again, and next day he was lying
prone, racked with all the pangs of rheumatic
fever. They twisted and tore his
little frame, and though at the last the doctor
pulled him through, and he rose again from
his bed, it was but as a shadow of his former
merry self—a stricken child, a cripple for life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Poor Susan—then thirteen—took it sorely
to heart. Her mother in heaven—had she
looked down that night when Bonnie lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>under the dripping tree, and seen her pretty
lamb alone, deserted?—the mother who had
left him to Susan to look after and care for.
She had seemed to think more of Bonnie in
her dying moments than of the baby who
had brought death to her with his own life.
Susan had been left in charge, as it were—sweet
Susan, who was barely twelve, and
who, with her soft, shy ways and lovely face,
should have been left in charge herself to
someone capable of guiding her tender footsteps
across earth’s thorny paths.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her remorse dwelt with her always, and
became a burden to her, and made havoc of
her colour for many a day. Of course she
grew out of all that—youth, thank God, is
always growing—and at last, after many
days, joy came to her again, and all the
glorious colour of life, and all the sweetness
of it. But she never lost a little pulsing
grief that came to her every now and then,
telling her how she ought to have seen that
Bonnie had not wandered so far afield.</p>

<p class='c004'>Oh, if only he could be made strong and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>well again. This was the heart of the sad
song that she often sang for herself alone,
when time was given her in her busy life.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had dreamed dreams of how it would
be with the little lad if he could have been
sent abroad. She had heard of certain baths,
and of wonderful cures worked by them. If
he could go abroad to one of them he might
recover. But such baths were as far out of
her reach as heaven itself. It seemed hard
to Susan, to whom life was still a riddle.
And she reproached herself always, and
always mourned that there would never
come a time when Bonnie would be strong
again, as he was when his mother left him,
and when she might meet that dear mother
in heaven without fear of reproaches.</p>

<p class='c004'>All this lay in the background of Susan’s
life, and now, as years grew, seldom came to
the front. But the child was ever her first
thought and her dearest delight, and the
fact that he was not as his brothers were
was the one little blot on the happiness of
her young life.</p>

<p class='c010'>About seven o’clock, Wyndham (who had
come up to Dublin by the afternoon train),
going down Nassau Street, finds himself face
to face with a tall, big, good-humoured-looking
man of about thirty-two.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hallo! that you?’ cries the latter,
stopping Wyndham, who, in somewhat preoccupied
mood, would have gone by without
seeing him. The preoccupation disappears
at once, however, and it is with genuine
pleasure that he grasps the hand held out to
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You, Crosby, of all men!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>‘Even so.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, last week, when we met in Paris,
you told me you were going to Vienna to see
a friend there.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The friend came to me at Paris instead
the very day after you left.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But I thought you had arranged with
him to go on an expedition to some unpronounceable
place in Africa?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So I had, but he proved disappointing.
Hummed and hawed, said he couldn’t go just
now, but perhaps a little later on. One saw
through him at once. I told him I never
travelled about with fellows’ wives, and that
settled it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He was going to be married?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course. Love was writ large all over
him—in huge capitals. And he was in such
a hurry over everything. People in love are
always in a hurry—to get back. So I dismissed
him with my blessing, and a bauble
for the venturesome young woman he has
chosen to explore life’s boundless ways with
him. R.I.P. He’s done for; and a right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>good fellow he was, too! Well, what’s up
with you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘With me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Think I can’t see? You’re out of your
luck in some way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nothing much, any way,’ says Wyndham,
with an involuntary smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Too vague—too vague by half,’ says
Crosby, laughing. It is the happiest,
heartiest laugh. ‘Come, what’s the matter?
Out with it. Money?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no,’ says the barrister, laughing in
turn.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still, there is something.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is there? I don’t know,’ says Wyndham,
in a tone half comical, half forlorn.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this Crosby thrusts his arm into his,
and wheels him down the street.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It must be hunger,’ says he gaily, seeing
the other is not ready for confession yet.
That the confession will come he knows
perfectly well. Ever since they were boys
together, Wyndham, whose brain was then,
as now, very superior to Crosby’s, had still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>always given in to the personal attractions of
the stronger and older boy, whose big fists
often fought Wyndham’s battles for him on
the public playground.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby had been a big boy then; he is a
big man now, and, in spite of his adventurous
wanderings by land and sea, looks younger
than Wyndham, though he is actually four
years older. A splendid man, bronzed,
bearded, and broad-shouldered, with the
grand look of one who has been through
many a peril and many a fight, who has led
a cleanly life, and can look the world in the
face fearlessly. His eyes are large and blue,
and full of life and gaiety. He has a heart
as true as gold, and a strong right arm, good
for the felling of a foe or the saving of a
friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For my own part, I’m starving,’ says he.
‘Come along; we’re near our club, and you’ll
dine with me. Considering what a stranger
I am in my own land, you’ll be able to help
me out a bit. I feel as if I did not know
anyone—that is, if you are not going anywhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>else. There’s a wandering look about you.
No? No other engagements? That’s good.’</p>

<p class='c004'>They have reached the steps of the Kildare
Street Club by this time, and presently are
in the pleasant dining-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘By the way, talking of engagements,’
says Crosby, between the soup and fish, ‘I
have one for to-night, at your aunt’s—Mrs.
Prior’s. In some odd fashion she heard I was
in Dublin, and sent a card to the Gresham
for me. You’—glancing at Wyndham’s
evening dress—‘are going somewhere, too,
perhaps?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There, too,’ says Wyndham. ‘I’ve got
out of it a good deal lately; but it doesn’t
do to offend her overmuch. She’s touchy.
And the old man, my uncle, Lord Shangarry—you
remember him, how he used to tip us
at school long ago?—makes quite a point of
my being civil to her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To her, or——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My cousin?’ Wyndham lifts his brows.
‘I feel sure my cousin is as indifferent to me
as I am to her.’ He pauses. ‘Still, I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>not conceal from you that my uncle desires a
marriage between us.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is this the cause of your late depression?’
asks Crosby, with a quizzical expression.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not it,’ says Wyndham. ‘By-the-by’—a
little hurriedly—‘what of that late adventure
of yours in Siam? You were just telling
me about it when——’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby at once plunges into the interrupted
anecdote, bringing it, however, to a somewhat
sharp close.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You know what life is!’ says Wyndham
a little moodily when it is over. ‘I envy
you; I often think I too should like to break
off the threads of society that bind one in,
and start on a career that would leave civilization
and—its worries behind.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Its worries?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, gossip for one thing, and that
delicate espionage that so often leads to the
damning of a man.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Poor old boy! Got into deep water,’
thinks Crosby whilst toying with his
champagne.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>‘Once in it, one never gets out of civilization,’
says he. ‘It sticks to one like a burr.
Don’t hope for that when you start on the
wild career you speak of. For myself, I like
civilization. It’s clean, for one thing—savages
don’t do much in the way of washing.
But I confess I like wandering for wandering’s
sake. It’s a mania with me. Here to-day
and gone to-morrow—that’s the motto that
suits me. Yet, I dare say, in time I shall get
tired of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not you. Where are you going next?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not made up my mind yet. But I’ll tell
you where I’ve been last—right into Arcadia!
A difficult place to find nowadays, the savants
tell you; but the savants, like the Cretans,
are all liars. And in my Arcadia I fell in
with an adventure, and met——’</p>

<p class='c004'>He pauses, and, leaning back in his chair,
clasps his hands behind his head and gives
way to silent laughter. Evidently some
memory is amusing him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Someone who apparently was kind to
you,’ says Wyndham indifferently, breaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>off from the stem, but not eating, the purple
grapes before him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Kind!’ says Crosby. ‘Hardly that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Unkind?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘More than that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She told you——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That I was a thief.’ Wyndham’s indifference
ceases for a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Strong language,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘True, I assure you. Do I look like one?
Ever since that terrible denunciation I have
often asked myself whether so much knocking
about as I have known has not ruffianized me
in appearance, at all events.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Where on earth is the Arcadia you speak
of?’ asks Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, to tell you everything, I went down
to Curraghcloyne this morning to have a look
at the old place.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What! There! Why, I was there
to-day, too,’ says Wyndham, and then pauses,
as if suddenly sorry he had spoken.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We must have missed each other, then,
and come up by different trains.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>‘I suppose so,’ says Wyndham slowly.
‘And so your Arcadia is Curraghcloyne?
Fancy an adventure there!’ He shrugs his
shoulders, and leans back in his chair. ‘You
have had so many real adventures that I
expect you like to revel in imagining one now
and then.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Perhaps so,’ says Crosby. ‘Still, even
in Arcadia one doesn’t like to be called a
thief. I say, it is getting late, isn’t it?
Your aunt spoke of ten. It is now well
after eleven. Buck up, my child, and let
us on.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The rooms are crowded to excess, and it is
with difficulty that Crosby and Wyndham
make their way to the place where someone
has told them their hostess is to be found.
They have arrived very late, in spite of
Crosby’s attempt at haste, so late, indeed,
that already some of the guests are leaving—a
fact that has somewhat embarrassed
their journey up the staircase. The heat is
intense, and the perfume of the many roses
makes the air heavy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quite at the end of the music-room
Wyndham sees his aunt, and presently she,
seeing him and Crosby in the doorway,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>makes them a faint salutation. The Hon.
Mrs. Prior is a tall woman, with a high,
aristocratic nose, fair hair, and blue eyes,
now a little pale. She was the handsomest
of the three daughters of Sir John Burke,
and, what is not always the case, had made
the best marriage. Her youngest sister,
Kate, had, however, done very well, too,
when she married James Wyndham, but
the eldest sister had made a distinct fiasco
of her life. She had run away with a ne’er-do-well,
a certain Robert Haines, who came
from no one knew where, and went no one
knew where, either, taking Sir John’s
favourite daughter with him. It was
hushed up at the time, but the old man
had caused ceaseless secret inquiries to be
made for the missing daughter, always, however,
without result. It was for a time a
blot upon the family history, but it was
forgotten after awhile, and Mrs. Prior and
her daughter have for some time taken leading
parts in Dublin society.</p>

<p class='c004'>A tall, thin woman is singing very beautifully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>as the two young men enter, and Mrs.
Prior’s slight movement of recognition to
her nephew conveys with it a desire that
he should not seek her until the song has
come to an end. And presently the last
quivering note dies away upon the air, and
the crowd is once more in motion. Lady
H—— is being congratulated on the beauties
of her voice by many people, and Mrs. Prior,
having done her part, is now able to receive
her nephew and Crosby without having to
pause and wonder who she is to speak to
next.</p>

<p class='c004'>Indeed, Lady H——’s singing has virtually
wound up the evening. Few would care to
sing after her, and now the rooms are
beginning to look deserted.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Always a laggard, Paul,’ says his aunt,
who, having bidden good-bye to her principal
guests, has left the rest to her daughter.
‘But I suppose something of it must be put
down to to-night.’ She smiles at Crosby,
whom she has known since he was a little boy.
‘You should have been here earlier, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>two; she sang even better in the beginning
of the evening. It was “Allan Water,” and
you know how that would suit her voice.
But now that you have come so late, you
must stay a little later and have supper
with Josephine and me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She talks on to them in her cultivated
yet somewhat hard voice, rising now and
then to say good-bye to someone, until the
rooms are quite cleared and her daughter is
able to join them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Josephine Prior comes across the polished
floor of the music-room to where they are
sitting in a curtained recess; she is as tall
as her mother, and as fair, and a little
harder. Miss Prior is undoubtedly the
handsomest girl in Dublin this season (now
all but over), and has been for the past
two or three. Tall, <i><span lang="fr">distinguée</span></i> and with
irreproachable manners, there are very few
who can outdo her. She sweeps up to them
now, her pretty silken skirts falling gracefully
around her, and her mother, rising,
motions her into her own seat, that next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>to Wyndham’s, while she sinks into a chair
on Crosby’s left.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had been a settled thing with Mrs.
Prior for years that Josephine, her only
child, should marry Paul Wyndham, who,
though only a barrister, is still a very rising
one, and heir to his grand-uncle, Lord
Shangarry. To know Josephine a countess!
There lay all the hope, all the ambition, of
Mrs. Prior’s life, and the fact that old Lord
Shangarry shared her hopes about this
matter naturally led to the idea that in
time it must be accomplished. If Paul were
to offend his uncle, then—well, then, the
title would be his indeed; but the enormous
income now attached to it, not being entailed,
could be left as Lord Shangarry wished.
Few people fly in the face of Providence
where thousands a year are concerned, and
Mrs. Prior depended upon Wyndham’s
common-sense to secure him as a husband
for her daughter. As for Wyndham, though
up to this not a syllable has passed between
him and Josephine to bind him to her in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>way, he has of late brought himself to believe
that a marriage with her, considering the
stakes, is not out of the question. She is a
handsome girl, too, and as a countess would
look the part.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, as she seats herself beside him, he
again acknowledges the beauty of her
chiselled nose and chin. But——yes; there
is a but. All at once it occurs to him
that beauty is very seldom to be found in
perfect features. The really artistic face
has always one feature quite beyond the
bounds of art. Strange that it had not
occurred to him before! Still, Josephine is
undoubtedly handsome.</p>

<p class='c004'>Josephine’s voice is like her mother’s—clear
and very hard. She is talking
now.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you know we were down in your part
of the world the other day?’ says she. ‘We
were lunching with dear Lady Millbank, and
then went on to your cottage. We wanted
to get some flowers. You know how mean
Lady Millbank is about her roses, so we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>decided on saying nothing to her, and trusting
to your place. But when we got there’—with
an elephantine attempt at playfulness—‘the
cupboard was bare, at all events
to us, because we could not get in.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, so odd!’ says Mrs. Prior. ‘We
rang, and rang, and rang, but no one came
for quite a long time. At last your housekeeper
appeared, a most disagreeable person,
my dear Paul. She was, indeed, almost rude,
and said she had your orders to admit
nobody.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She looks back at Wyndham, who looks
back at her with an immovable countenance.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not my orders, certainly,’ says he calmly.
‘I was abroad until the other day, you know,
so I can hardly be responsible for Mrs.
Moriarty’s manœuvres.’</p>

<p class='c004'>His voice is perfectly even, though a
perfect storm of rage against Mrs. Denis
is rendering him furious. Confound the
woman! what does she mean by seeking to
create a scandal out of a mere nothing—a
mountain out of a mole-hill?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Crosby, glancing at him steadily for a
moment, turns his eyes away again, and
breaks into the discussion.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am sorry you did not go up to my
place,’ says he, addressing Miss Prior. ‘It
is quite a terrible thing to contemplate,
your having been in want of flowers.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, but you weren’t there!’ says Josephine,
with a mild attempt at coquetry.
‘If you had been, we might have made a
raid on you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I’m at home now,’ says Crosby
cheerfully. ‘You must come down some
day soon, and help me to gather my roses.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You mean to stay, then?’ says Josephine,
leaning a little towards him across her
mother. She is quite bent on marrying
her cousin, though she is as indifferent to
him as he is to her; but in the meantime
she is not above a slight flirtation with
Crosby. To tell the truth, this big, good-humoured,
handsome man appeals to her far
more than Paul has ever done.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Until the autumn, at all events,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>As for Wyndham, he is still sitting mute,
apparently listening to his aunt’s diatribes
about society, and Dublin society in particular,
but in reality raging over Mrs.
Denis’s shortcomings, and the deplorable
Irish sympathetic nature that has led her
to sacrifice everything—even the excellent
situation she has at the Cottage—to a mere
passing fancy for a girl whom she has known
at the longest for four or five weeks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby, noting his abstraction, is still
rattling along.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now, it’s a promise, Mrs. Prior, isn’t
it? You’—here he glances deliberately at
Josephine—‘you will come and look round
my place soon, won’t you? I’m thinking of
making up a little house-party in September
or August, and I hope you and Miss Prior
will leave a week open for me.’ He throws
a look over his shoulder. ‘You too, Wyndham?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thank you,’ says Paul absently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What a charming idea!’ cries Josephine
ecstatically. Here she decides upon clapping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>her hands, and she does it in her perfectly
well-bred way. The result is deadly. ‘To
stay with a bachelor! Mamma, you will
consent?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mamma consents. Josephine, again leaning
towards Crosby, says something delightful
to him. It has seemed to her since
Crosby’s coming that to have two strings to
your bow is a very desirable thing. Paul
is well enough, and in the end, of course,
she will marry him, though at times she
has thought that he——But, of course,
that is nonsense. He would be afraid to
marry anyone else—afraid of his uncle.
What a pity he is not Mr. Crosby, or Mr.
Crosby Paul! Well, one can’t have everything
one’s own way, after all, and there is
the title. Lady Shangarry—Mrs. Crosby.
Yes; the title counts. But really Paul is
so very dull, and Mr. Crosby, though he
has no title, so infinitely better off than Paul
will ever be, and the Crosbys are an old
family, dating back to—goodness knows
when! Still, a title!</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Finally she gets back to the title, and
stays there.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But yes, really, dear Paul,’ Mrs. Prior is
saying, ‘I think that housekeeper of yours,
or caretaker, or whatever she is, takes too
much upon her. I tried to explain to her
I was your aunt, and, indeed, she has seen
me several times, but I could not shake her
determination to let no one in. Anyone
might be excused for imagining that she
was concealing something.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Garden-party for her own friends, no
doubt,’ says Crosby. He has cast a half-amused,
half-inquiring glance at Wyndham;
but the latter’s face is impassive.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think it a little serious,’ says Mrs. Prior.
‘Young men, as a rule, are always imposed
upon by women of her class—caretakers, of
course, I mean,’ with a careful glance at the
innocent Josephine. ‘Landladies and that.
Do you think, dear Paul, that she is quite
honest?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Quite, I think.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then why this extraordinary step on her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>part—this locking out your very nearest
and’—with an open glance at Josephine—‘dearest?
No, no, George,’ to Crosby, ‘you
really must not jest on this subject. I feel
it is quite important where Paul is concerned.
You really know of no reason,
Paul, why she should have forbidden us an
entrance?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Is there meaning in the question? Wyndham
looks at her steadily before replying.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I was in France at the time,’ says he
carelessly. ‘If she had a motive, how could
I know it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby leans back and crosses his arms
negligently. ‘What an idiotic equivocation!’
thinks he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You certainly ought to speak to her
about it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course I shall speak to her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby smiles.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I really think you ought,’ says Mrs. Prior.
‘You can’—severely—‘mention me if you
wish. I consider she behaved extremely
badly. And I quite tremble for the dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>little old place. You know it was an uncle
of ours—a grand-uncle of yours—who left
the place to your mother, and as girls we—that
is, your aunts and I—used to be very
fond of running up from your grandfather’s
place in Kerry to spend a few weeks in it.
We were all girls then—your mother, and I,
and your——’ She stops, and sneezes most
opportunely behind her lace handkerchief.
The innocent Josephine had touched her foot
under cover of her gown. Of course the
aunt who had disappeared so unpleasantly
had better not be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope, Paul, you will see that this woman
keeps the dear old place in order,’ says Mrs.
Prior rather hastily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To confess a dreadful truth,’ says Wyndham,
smiling somewhat briefly, ‘I have almost
made up my mind to let the Cottage. It has
been rather a burden to me of late. And——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To let it. But why?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, as you see yourself,’ says Wyndham
desperately, ‘Mrs. Moriarty does not seem
capable of looking after it. It is an awful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>bore, you know, and’—with a rush of affection
hitherto unborn—‘the idea of her
having kept you out of the place seems to
put an end to my trust in her for ever.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby flicks a little point of dust off
his coat-sleeve. ‘Oh, the handsome liar!’
thinks he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, my dear boy, you must not be too precipitate.
A word to her would perhaps——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ve quite made up my mind,’ says Wyndham
steadfastly. ‘I shall look out for a
tenant.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Dear Paul!’ says Mrs. Prior, touched by
this nephew-like act, ‘I of course appreciate
your sweetness in this matter. It is very
dear of you to be so angry about the
woman’s incivility to me, and if you have
made up your mind about getting a tenant
for the dear old Cottage, I think I can help
you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Crosby leans forward. It is proving
very interesting.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You mustn’t take any trouble,’ says
Wyndham; ‘I couldn’t allow you.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>‘It will be no trouble—for you,’ says
Josephine, breaking into the conversation
very affectionately.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thanks awfully, but I think I’ve got a
desirable tenant in my eye,’ says Wyndham—‘one
suitable in every respect.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The real thing is to know if he is solvent,’
says Mrs. Prior.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I think so—I think so,’ says Wyndham
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is he young or old?’ asks Josephine, who
feels she ought to show some interest in his
affairs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham remains wrapt up in thought
for a moment, then apparently wakes up.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, the tenant,’ says he dreamily. ‘Not
old; no, not old!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘At that rate you must introduce us to
him,’ says Mrs. Prior, with quite surprising
archness. ‘Solvent and not old! Quite a
desirable acquaintance! What is his name,
Paul?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know,’ says Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not know? But, my dear Paul!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>‘I positively don’t,’ says Wyndham, in
quite a loud voice. It occurs to Crosby that
now at last he is telling the truth, and that
he is wildly glad at being able to do so. But
the truth! Where does it come in? Crosby
grows curious. ‘Strange as it may sound, the
name is unknown to me. And for the matter
of that nothing is settled. There have been
only preliminaries. There must always be
preliminaries, you know,’ talking briskly to
his aunt.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, be careful,’ says Mrs. Prior. ‘And
whatever you do, Paul, don’t take a lady
tenant. They are so difficult. Now promise
me, Paul, you won’t take a lady as a tenant.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Providentially, at this moment the very
late supper is announced, and Paul, rising,
gives his arm to Josephine, after which the
conversation drifts into other channels.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The moon is streaming brilliantly over the
silent streets as the two men leaving Fitzwilliam
Square turn presently into Stephen’s
Green and then down Dawson Street.
Crosby’s footsteps are bound for the Gresham
Hotel, and Wyndham, who should have gone
the other way, considering his rooms are in
Elgin Road, walks with him silently, and so
mechanically that it becomes at once plain
to Crosby that he has lost himself a little in
a world of troublous thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Determining to let him find his way out
of his mind’s labyrinth by himself, Crosby
maintains a discreet silence, refraining even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>from good words and the whistle that has
come to be part of him during his strange
wanderings by sea and land, and is difficult
to discard when in the midst of civilization.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not until they have reached the railings
that run round Trinity College, where
the glorious light of the moon is lighting up
the old and splendid pile, that Wyndham
speaks.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ve had the deuce of a time,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I could see that,’ says Crosby, turning
his cigar in his fingers. ‘I’m rather disappointed
in you, do you know, Paul. How
you are to make a fortune out of your profession
is to me a mystery. Throw it up.
You are certainly not a liar born.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m in a tight place,’ says Wyndham
disgustedly, ‘but I dare say I’ll get out of
it. Well’—reluctantly—‘good-night.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not a bit of it,’ says Crosby, tucking his
arm into his; ‘come and have a pipe with
me, and—if you can bring yourself to it—give
voice to this worry of yours, and get it
off your mind.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>A pipe is a great help; soothed by it, and
the influence of the society of his old chum,
Wyndham, seated comfortably in a huge
armchair in Crosby’s room, tells the latter
the whole of his remarkable acquaintance
with his unknown guest at the Cottage.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is, to confess the truth, a rather lame
story, very lamely told; and at the close of
it Wyndham looks at his friend, at least at
as much of him as he can see, Crosby being
now enclouded in smoke. He had been
smoking very vigorously, indeed, all through
the recital, and there had been moments
when he had seemed to be choking, but
whether altogether from the smoke Wyndham
felt uncertain.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, that’s the story,’ says he at last,
flinging himself back in his chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a short silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then I suppose you could not think of a
better one?’ says Crosby, beginning to choke
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I knew how you’d take it—how any
fellow would take it,’ says Wyndham wrathfully.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>‘I can see that there isn’t a soul in
the world who would believe such an idiotic
story as mine. But there it is, and you can
take it or leave it as you like. But for all
that, Crosby, you ought to know me well
enough to understand that I should not
trouble myself to lie to you unless there was
occasion for it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this Crosby gives way to a roar.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I honestly believe there’s no
occasion now,’ says he; ‘and for the rest,
dear old chap! of course I believe every
word you have said. You must be thoroughly
hipped, or you’d have seen how I was enjoying
the joke. Come, it seems we have both
had adventures in Arcadia, and that we
have both come in rather sorry fashion out
of them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you—you can afford to speak of
adventures,’ says Wyndham ruefully.
‘You’re accustomed to them, but I—I confess
this last and first has been enough for
me. You who have faced lions——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not so many, after all,’ interrupts Crosby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>laughing. ‘Don’t magnify them like that.
I’ve shot a few, I confess, but I only seem
to remember seven. One does remember
them when one’s face to face with them.
But there is not such a lot to remember,
after all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It would serve, so far as I am concerned,’
says Wyndham frankly. ‘Indeed, I think
I could do with one—always supposing he
was dead. As for how I feel now, it is as
though I were in a den of them, and I doubt
if I’ll come as well out of it as Daniel did.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby regards him with an amused eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Apropos your tenant,’ says he, ‘when
are you going to introduce your aunt to your
young man?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, get out!’ says Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s a lion if you like,’ says Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Which—my aunt or my tenant?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I haven’t seen the tenant. Still, it
strikes me that she will be a lion, too. I’d
get out of that den if I were you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I want to. But what’s one to do?
I can’t get rid of either of my lions.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>‘Not even of the tenant?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t see how I can, now I have given
my promise.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, introduce them to each other;
that’s a capital suggestion if you will only
look into it. Whilst they claw each other,
you may be able to make your escape.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Introduce them?’ Wyndham pauses, as
if sounding the proposition, then gives way
to wrath. ‘Hang it!’ says he; ‘you are
worse than Job’s three comforters all rolled
into one.’</p>

<p class='c010'>To-day is Sunday—the first Sunday since
that eventful day when Susan had tackled
and disarmed the thief, and certainly the
warmest day that has come this season. In
here in the church the heat is almost intolerable;
and Susan, when the Litany
begins, feels her devotion growing faint.</p>

<p class='c004'>She has, indeed, up to this had a good
deal of troublous excitement. To keep one
eye on Jacky, who had left home in a distinctly
resentful mood, and the other on
Tommy, who doesn’t believe in churches as
a satisfactory playground, is a task to which
few would be equal; and even now, when
Tommy has been reduced to silence by Betty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>and lemon-drops, the excessive warmth of
the day leaves Susan too tired to follow the
beautiful service.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mechanically she says, ‘We beseech Thee
to hear us, good Lord’; but her mind is
wandering, and presently her eyes begin to
wander too.</p>

<p class='c004'>The curate, how hideous he is, poor little
man! and what a pity he is so painfully
conscious of the loss of his front tooth! and
what a lovely light that is from the window
falling on his gown! It must be nice outside
now. How the flies are buzzing on the
panes, just like the organ! Maria Tanner
should not be laughing like that; if father
saw her he would be so angry, and Maria is
such a nice girl, and so clever—took all the
prizes at the diocesan examination last year—and
her sister is considered quite an
excellent housemaid by Lady Millbank.
What a pretty bonnet Lady Millbank has
on! Those violets suit her. Who is the
man in the pew behind her? Why, that is
the Crosby pew, and——</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>For one awful minute Susan feels the walls
of the church closing in upon her; a sensation
of faintness, a trembling of the knees, oppress
her. She is conscious of all this, and
then the mist fades away.</p>

<p class='c004'>No, no; of course it is not true. It is
impossible. A remarkable likeness, no more.
She could laugh almost at her own folly,
and very nearly does so in her nervous
state; but providentially the sight of a
gloomy black and white tablet, erected to
the memory of a dead and gone Crosby, that
stands out from the wall right before her,
prevents this act of desecration.</p>

<p class='c004'>She—she will look again, if only to assure
herself of her own folly. Slowly, slowly she
lifts her eyes—the eyes that now are standing
in a very white face—and looks with a
desperate courage at the Crosby pew. Her
eyes meet full the eyes of its one occupant,
and then Susan tells herself that it is all
over, and death alone is to be looked for.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the eyes of the Crosby pew man are
the eyes of Susan’s thief. There can be no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>mistake about it any longer. The man who
sits in Mr. Crosby’s pew and Susan’s repentant
thief are one and the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her eyes seem to cling to his. In the
fever of horror that has overtaken her, she
feels as if she could never remove them. For
a full minute the man in the Crosby pew and
Susan kneel, staring at each other; and then
suddenly something happens. Lady Millbank,
who is sitting in the pew before that
of the Crosbys, turns round and hands
Susan’s thief a Prayer-book. That in itself
would be very well—everyone should give a
thief a Prayer-book—but Lady Millbank has
accompanied her gift with a friendly nod of
recognition, a charming smile—the smile that
Susan so well knows, the smile that is only
given to those whom Lady Millbank desires
to honour or to be in with.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is all quite plain now. The thief is Mr.
Crosby, and Susan with a groan lets her face
fall upon her clasped hands, and hopes vainly
for the earth to open and swallow her up
quick.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>But the earth is a stupid thing, and never
does anything nowadays. Not a single earthquake
appears for Susan’s accommodation,
and the good old church is not conscious of
even a quiver. The service goes on. The
Litany is done. They all rise from their
knees, and the curate gives out a hymn:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘“O Paradise! O Paradise!”’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Poor Susan feels as if ‘O Purgatory!’
would be much nearer it, so far as she is
concerned. She would have stopped the
hymn there and then if she could, feeling
utterly upset and nervous. But it would
take a great many feelings to stop a church
service when it is once in full swing; and the
hymn goes on gaily in spite of Susan’s despair.
It reaches, indeed, a most satisfactory
ending, in spite of a slight contretemps
occasioned by the one unlucky Protestant
maid belonging to the Rectory, called Sarah.</p>

<p class='c004'>Poor Sarah has this day for the first time
put on a hat of which a brilliant magenta
feather is the principal feature. Hitherto it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>has not caught Miss Barry’s eye—a wonder
in itself even greater than the magenta
feather, as this estimable spinster, with a
view to keeping the servants’ moral conduct
perfect, has elected that they shall sit on a
bench in the big square Rectory pew right
before her and her nephew and nieces.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is at the beginning of the first verse
that Miss Barry’s eye lights on the monstrosity
in Sarah’s hat. Feathers and flowers
are abominations in Miss Barry’s eyes when
worn by the ‘common people,’ as she calls
those beneath her in the social scale. How
dare that impertinent girl come to church
with such an immodest ornament on her
head! What on earth is the world coming
to? She must, she will, speak to her; impossible
to let her enjoy that feather another
second.</p>

<p class='c004'>If she can’t speak, she can at all events
sing at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She darts across the pew, and, leaning
over Sarah’s shoulder, sings piercingly into
her ear:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“‘O Paradise! O Paradise.”  Sarah, what
do you mean?’ (Rising note.) ‘How dare’
(prolonged shriek on top note) ‘you wear that
feather, girl! Where did you get that hat?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She is simply screaming this to the hymn-tune.
You all know the hymn, of course,
and can understand how Miss Barry’s voice
rose to a shrill yell in the ‘dare.’ Sarah,
with a convulsive start, turns round. It
seems to her that this loud voice shouting in
her ear must be heard by every other soul in
the church; and frightened, ashamed, she
sinks down into her seat, and prepares to
hide herself and the magenta feather behind
her Prayer-book. But at this breach of
church etiquette Miss Barry grows even
more incensed, and proceeds to rouse the
wretched girl to a sense of her further
iniquity by well-directed and vigorous
punches and prods of her Prayer-book on
her back. Whereon Sarah, dissolved in
tears, rises to her feet once more. She is
evidently on the verge of hysterics, and
would have undoubtedly given way to them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>but that at this moment Betty, who is afraid
of nothing under heaven, lays her hand on
Miss Barry’s arm, and forcibly pulls her back
to her accustomed place.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hymn has now come to an end, and
only Sarah’s stifled groanings are heard upon
the air. Most people take these to be the
buzzing of the innumerable bluebottles collected
in the window-panes, so that the
whole affair goes off better than might have
been expected.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly, slowly, go the minutes; slower and
slower still is the voice of the curate, as
he intones the Commandments. The bluebottles,
as if invigorated by it, buzz louder
than ever, until poor Sarah’s sobs are completely
drowned.</p>

<p class='c004'>The heat grows more and more intense.
Jacky, beneath its pressure, has fallen sound
asleep, and is now giving forth loud and
handsome snorings. Miss Barry, horrified,
makes frantic signs to Dominick, who is next
to the culprit, to stop this unsolicited
addition to the church music that Jacky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>has so ‘kindly consented’ to give, and Dom
waves back at her wildly. No, no, of course.
He quite understands; he will see that no
one interferes with the dear boy’s slumbers
on any account whatever. The wavings
backwards and forwards grow fast and
furious—furious on the part of Miss Barry,
and really as fast as lightning on the part
of Mr. Fitzgerald, who is having a thoroughly
<i><span lang="fr">bon quart d’heure</span></i>; but Carew ends it.</p>

<p class='c004'>He has been trying mentally to get through
one of his papers for his next examination,
and finding Jacky’s snores a deadly interruption
to his thoughts, he fetches that resounding
hero a telling kick on a part that shall be
nameless, which brings him not only to his
senses, but the floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a momentary confusion in the
Rectory pew; but as every member of the
congregation is more or less drowsing, Jacky
is picked up and restored to his seat before
the real meaning of the confusion is known.
And, indeed, when anyone does look, all the
Barrys are sitting so demure and innocent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>that no one could connect them with anything
out of the way. Susan, alone flushed
and unnerved, in spite of her determination
not to do it, looks quickly at the Crosby
pew, to find the thief looking at her with a
singular intensity of regard. It is at this
moment that Susan, for the first time in her
young, happy life, wakes to sympathy with
those unfortunate people who sometimes wish
that they were dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>The curate, a short, squat little man—a
man so short, indeed, that a footstool has had
to be placed in the pulpit for him to let the
congregation see him as he preaches—is now
droning away like the flies, ‘shooting out
shafts of eloquence to the bucolic mind’ is
how he puts it when writing to his people;
but even his people, if here, could hardly
catch the shafts to-day. The fact is, he has
not yet had time to get in the teeth he lost
by his fall last week; and, however admirable
his discourse may be, the beauties of
it are known to him alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmers who are awake are leaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>forward, their hands to their ears to catch
the Gospel words that never reach them.
Lady Millbank has fallen gracefully asleep.
Sarah is still weeping copiously, but now,
thank Heaven, quietly. The curate, vainly
striving to pronounce his ‘this’ and his
‘that,’ grows more and more nervous. He
leans over the pulpit, and thunders at the
sleeping farmers and at the leading families
around, in whose pews, too, Somnus is
holding a full court. Farther and farther
he leans, striving with his parishioners as
much as with his teeth; a very passion of
anxiety grows upon him. He lifts his arms
from the desk before him—the desk that is
supporting him—and waves them frantically.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hear—hear, my brethren,’ cries he.
‘Hear and see——’</p>

<p class='c004'>His cry, like the ‘Excelsior’ young man’s
clarion, rings loud and clear. It wakes some
of the sleepy members, who look up to see
what it is all about. But when they do look
up there is nothing to see.</p>

<p class='c004'>Most unexpectedly and disgracefully—considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>its relation to the Church—the footstool
has given way with a crash, and Mr.
Haldane, the curate, has given way with it,
and disappeared, holus bolus, into the big old
pulpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>For quite a minute, though no doubt ‘to
memory dear,’ the curate is certainly ‘lost
to sight;’ and when at last he ventures once
more to mount the offending stool, and look
down at his parishioners, it is to find that the
far larger half of them are gladly streaming
down the aisle to the fresh air outside, under
the fond delusion that ‘church is over.’</p>

<p class='c004'>These are the specially drowsy ones. The
crash caused by the curate’s unpremeditated
descent had roused them from their happy
dreams, and, on opening their eyes, seeing no
preacher in the pulpit, they had naturally
come to the conclusion that the performance
was at an end.</p>

<p class='c004'>Vain to call them back. Mr. Haldane
spreads out his arms to heaven in a mournful
appeal, but, hearing some unmistakable tittering
to his left, turns, and incontinently flies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not so quickly as Susan, however. He could
hardly have flown with the fleetness of that
heart-troubled nymph. She—at the first
chance, when her father, rising hurriedly at
the flight of his curate, had breathed the
blessing—had flown down the side-aisle and
through the small oak door into the golden
air outside; and from there into a small lane
filled with flowering weeds, that led straight
homewards.</p>

<p class='c004'>Running—racing, indeed—goes Susan, with
her heart on fire, as her cheeks, and her
lovely, child-like eyes darkened and bright
with the sense of coming disaster.</p>

<p class='c004'>She does not draw breath until she finds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>herself safe in her own little room, with just
five precious minutes (precious, unusual five
minutes, gained only by that swift run that
has left them all behind) in which to think
out as calmly as she can what has befallen
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>A thief! She had called him a thief! He—Mr.
Crosby—the distinguished traveller!
Oh! what is to become of her? Not even
now, at this last gasp, does she try to persuade
herself that the man in the Crosby pew
was a fraud—that he wasn’t Mr. Crosby.
She knows as positively as though she had
been introduced to him that he is Mr.
Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>Introduced to him! As if——She covers
her face with her hands. No, no; there need
be no fear of that. He will go away soon—at
once. People say he cannot bear civilized
life; that he always hankers after savages,
and lions, and things. He will go away, of
course. Oh, if only he will go away soon
enough, and never come back! Susan, with
her hands before her gentle eyes, has sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>dreams of people who have been devoured by
lions, and for the first time fails to see the
extreme horror of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yes, he will go away soon; and in the
meantime—well, in the meantime it is very
unlikely that she will come face to face with
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, Susan! are you there?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Susan. She goes to the door,
and finds Jacky on the threshold of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Dinner is ready,’ says that solemn youth;
‘and they sent me up for you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can’t come down,’ says Susan. ‘I have
a headache. Jacky—dear, dear Jacky, say I
have a headache. And I have, too—I have
indeed. There won’t be any lie. The heat—you
must have felt the heat in church—you
fell asleep——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I know,’ says Jacky, in his queer
way, that always expresses anger with difficulty
suppressed. ‘You won’t come down,
then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; I can’t—I——’ She lifts her hand
to her head.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Jacky hesitates, turns slowly, and then
throws a glance at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, did you see that man in the
Crosby pew?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan’s nerves being a little overwrought,
she almost jumps at this.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes,’ says she in a hurried way.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He was very like the thief, wasn’t he?’
says Jacky anxiously. Susan colours hotly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense, Jacky’—with a very poor attempt
at scorn. ‘That gentleman in Mr.
Crosby’s pew was, I think, Mr. Crosby himself,
or, at all events, some friend of his.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, the thief was the image of him,’
says Jacky slowly. That’s the worst of
Jacky, he is always so abominably slow. ‘I
looked at him, and I said to myself, “That’s
Susan’s thief,” and,’ with awful obstinacy, ‘I
think it was, too.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no, no!’ says Susan. ‘It was Mr.
Crosby, I tell you. I saw Lady Millbank
nod and smile at him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Jacky considers.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Very well,’ says he, in a thoroughly unconvinced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>tone. He moves away a bit and
then looks back.  ‘If that is true,’ says he,
‘Mr. Crosby looks like a thief.’</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c004'>At half-past three Susan, having come to
the conclusion that sitting up here won’t help
her out of her difficulty, wanders downstairs
and into the schoolroom, where Betty makes
much of her, and makes her sandwiches out
of the still warm mutton, which, in spite
of their nastiness and her headache, Susan
devours with avidity. Hunger is a great
sauce; no one has ever yet invented one to
beat it. And perhaps, if all were known,
Susan’s ache belongs more to the heart than
the head. When the sandwiches are finished,
she declares herself much better, and Jane
coming to say that Lady Millbank is in the
drawing-room, she rises, and expresses a
desire to see her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lady Millbank, or ‘the Sack,’ as the
irreverent young Barrys always call her,
thinks it the correct thing to be in with, and
civil to, her Rector—without giving herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>any unnecessary trouble. The drive from
Millbank to the parish church is five good
miles, so she always makes a point of lunching
with some of her friends and taking afternoon
tea at the Rectory. Even so far she
would not have condescended, but that the
Rector, poor as he is, has sprung from a good
old stock, and that his wife was a connection
of the late Sir Geoffrey Millbank.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So sorry to hear you have been ill,’ says
she, as Susan enters. Susan is a favourite of
hers. ‘The heat, eh?’ She speaks exactly
as she looks. She is one of those people who
can be very gracious when they like, and
perfectly abominable on other occasions.
She is ugly and shapeless, and careless about
her dress, but no one can mistake for a
minute that she is well born.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was very warm,’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You look pale, my dear. I think, Miss
Barry, she ought not to go to church this
evening.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no, of course not, Susan,’ says Miss
Barry severely; she is sitting behind a wonderfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>battered old teapot that has certainly
seen service, and must have been pure at
heart to have come out of the trial thus
victoriously, though maimed and wounded.
It is the pride of Miss Barry’s life, and has
come down to the Rector after many days.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose you saw that George Crosby has
come home?’ says Lady Millbank. ‘I had
heard a rumour of his coming a week or so
ago, but thought nothing of it. Such a man
as he is can never be relied upon, and when
he turned up actually alive last week, I was
more surprised than I can tell you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Last week! She had seen him, had
talked with him. Had he told her? Susan’s
heart sinks within her. Positive despair
makes her raise her eyes and look at Lady
Millbank. Oh, if——</p>

<p class='c004'>But Lady Millbank is still chatting on,
and in her eyes, as they meet Susan’s, there
is no <i><span lang="fr">arrière-pensée</span></i>. No; he had not
betrayed her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t suppose we shall see much of him;
he is always on the stampede,’ Lady Millbank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>is saying. ‘One would think from his
habits that he was a criminal running before
the law. I told him so. Ah’—rising suddenly
and looking out of the window—‘there
he is! And coming here! Of course, to call
upon Mr. Barry. Your brother was a great
friend of George Crosby’s father, I think.
Eh?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There was a friendship,’ says Miss Barry.
‘Susan, how pale you are! Come out of
that dark corner, child, and sit near the
window. The air will do you good.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I like being here,’ says Susan quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no time to say any more. Susan’s
‘thief’ is in the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>‘A secret is in my custody if I keep it; but if I blab
it, it is I that am prisoner.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rector has come in, and has stayed
to have a cup of tea with Mr. Crosby. Lady
Millbank declares herself charmed and very
jealous. He never leaves his beloved books
to see her! Mr. Barry smiles, and then falls
back upon the memories of Crosby’s father
that are always so dear to him. He is a tall,
gaunt man, severe, with a far-away look, and
the indifferent air of those who live with dead
authors, and who are, besides, a little worried
by the money transactions of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>To have to think of the daily needs is
hateful to Mr. Barry, who ought to have
been a bachelor, with nothing but his notes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>to worry him, living in a world in which he
could sit loosely. Even now he sometimes
forgets how time flies, and to tell him that
Susan is almost a woman grown would have
roused him to quite an extraordinary wonder.
The world goes on whilst he stands still, and
to-day the dragging of him out of his shell,
even to the ordinary business of a drawing-room
conversation, has bewildered him. After
a little while he retires.</p>

<p class='c004'>His sermons, his visits to the sick, the poor
(he never visits the rich unless they specially
send for him)—all these things concern him.
But when he knows himself happiest is
when his study-door is shut for the night to
all intruders, and he can read, read, read,
until the little hours begin to chime.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Crosby entered the drawing-room,
Susan felt her heart stand still. She rose
mechanically, and held out her hand to him
as he came up to her, but she did not lift her
eyes. She felt vaguely conscious that she
had flushed over cheek and brow. Such
a blush! So quick! so deep! Oh, he must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>have seen it, and known the meaning of
it!</p>

<p class='c004'>If he did, he made no sign whatever; and
until the departure of Lady Millbank he
devoted himself to the Rector.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Lady Millbank rose to say good-bye,
Susan told herself that now at last the ordeal
was at an end, and that he would go too.
But, apparently, he had no intention whatever
of stirring. And the climax came when Dom
and Carew asked him to come out into the
garden and have a cigarette. The cigarettes
were Dom’s. Mr. Crosby seemed only too
willing to accept this lively invitation, and
Dom, thrusting his arm through Betty’s,
asked her to come along with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And you, Miss Barry,’ says Crosby, now
walking up deliberately to Susan, who is still
sitting in her shady corner. The elder Miss
Barry had gone out into the hall to bid Lady
Millbank a last adieu, and tell her of the
latest misdoings of the young women of the
Christian Association in Curraghcloyne. ‘I
hope you will come too.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>‘Oh yes, Susan, come on,’ says Betty.
‘It’s lovely outside to-day, and father won’t
be able to see the smoke through the beech
hedge.’ The Rector objects to smoking, so
that Dom and Carew have quite a time of it
keeping their pipes and cigarettes out of his
way.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope you will come,’ says Crosby. He
is bending over Susan now, and he has distinctly
lowered his tone. ‘Do you know, I
have come over to-day to see and thank you.
I felt it quite my duty to do it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To thank me?’ For the first time during
the afternoon Susan looks straight at him.
Her large and lovely eyes are full of wonderment.
‘To thank me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, indeed; I have great cause to be
grateful to you,’ says Mr. Crosby, with such
extreme earnestness and gravity that she
rises. What if, after all, she was wrong, and
the thief was not really Mr. Crosby?</p>

<p class='c004'>A cousin perhaps—a disagreeable one:
cousins are very often disagreeable, and
often, too, more like one than one’s own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>brothers are. Of course, if he was a kinsman,
Mr. Crosby would be very grateful to
her for hushing up the whole affair, and
telling nobody. And yet——</p>

<p class='c004'>Again she lifts her eyes and studies his
face. No, not even twins were ever so alike
as this man and the man that stole the
cherries.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you coming?’ calls Betty impatiently,
and Susan moves forward. In a moment she
is stepping from the low sill of the Rectory
drawing-room on to the little plot of grass
beneath, disregarding Mr. Crosby’s hand as
he holds it out to help her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She and he are well behind the others now,
and Crosby speaks again.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You don’t ask me why I am grateful,’
says he reproachfully. ‘Don’t you care to
know? I care to tell you. I have had it on
my mind since that day in the garden. You
remember?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Susan. She stops short, and
confronts him with flushed cheeks and nervous
eyes, but a little touch of courage that sits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>most charmingly upon her. ‘I do remember.
You—you were the man who——’ She
hesitates.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Stole the cherries?’ suggests he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No’—coldly—‘who sat on the top of the
ladder and made fun of me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a little silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is a most unkind speech,’ says
Crosby at last. ‘After all, I don’t feel as
grateful now as I did a minute ago. I came
here to-day to thank you for looking so
kindly after my property, and you meet me
with an accusation that absolutely strikes
me dumb.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this Susan cannot refrain from bitter
jest.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘True,’ says she scornfully; ‘one can see
how silent you are.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Crosby regards her with apparent awe,
tempered with grief.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you persist in your present course,’
says he, ‘I shall commit suicide. There will
be nothing else left for me to do.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In the meantime,’ says Susan, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>astonishing spirit, ‘you had better come into
the garden. They are expecting you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Not so very much, after all. Betty, Carew,
and Dom Fitzgerald are engaged in a lively
discussion on Miss Barry’s wild attack on the
unoffending Sarah in church this morning,
and, in the delights of it, have almost
forgotten Mr. Crosby. The children are
playing about on the tennis-ground below,
and Crosby’s eyes fall on Bonnie, as with
great difficulty, and with the help of a stick,
he tries to follow little Tom. Jacky, in the
distance, is stretched on his stomach reading.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Those are your brothers?’ asks Crosby,
looking more deliberately at Bonnie, whose
charming little face, though pale and emaciated,
attracts him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I have four brothers and one sister.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Five brothers, I thought.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no; Dominick Fitzgerald is our cousin.
He lives with us nearly altogether, and father
is coaching him for the Indian Civil.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I see. That little brother’—gently indicating
Bonnie—‘does not look very strong.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>‘No, he had rheumatic fever, and he has
not been’—correcting herself hastily, as
though it is impossible to her to say the
more terrible word—‘very strong since.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What a beautiful face!’ says Crosby involuntarily.
And, indeed, the loveliest flower
of all this handsome Barry family is the little
suffering cripple child.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan is conscious for a moment of a
choking in her throat. Oh, her little lovely
darling brother! To hear him praised is a
great joy to her, but with the joy follows
pain unutterable. If only she had looked
more closely after him! And poor, poor
mamma, who had told her to be a mother to
him! Then, all at once, she remembers the
cherries, and how he had enjoyed them, and
a queer passion of feeling, arising first of all
from the fact that Crosby had admired the
child, makes her turn to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Crosby, I want to tell you something,’
says she timidly; ‘those cherries that you
sent me’—he is about to tease her again, to
pretend he knows nothing of the gift, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>her face, pale now and filled with a strange
but carefully-held-back emotion, keeps him
silent—‘they gave Bonnie a happy half-hour.
No matter how I am feeling towards you,
about your pretending to be—you know—still,
if only for the pleasure your cherries
gave Bonnie, I feel intensely thankful to
you. He is not strong, as you see. They
say he will never be strong again, and it was
my fault; for I forgot him one day—one day—and
mamma was dead too. I was cross to
you about your pretending to be a thief—I
hope you won’t mind me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is such a childish speech, and there is
such tragedy in the dark eyes! She has
not broken down at all. There is not a
suspicion of tears in her low, clear young
voice, but that the child’s ill-health is a constant
grief to her is not to be doubted for
a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If it comes to that,’ says he slowly, ‘it
is I who ought to apologize. And the worst
of it is, I haven’t an apology ready. The
plain truth is that I couldn’t resist the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>situation. If I could hope that you would
try to forgive me——’</p>

<p class='c004'>He breaks off. Susan has looked at him,
and through the deep gloom of a minute ago
a smile has broken on her face. Such a
smile! It makes her look about twelve
years old, and is indescribably pretty.
‘What a lovely child!’ says Crosby to himself.
She holds out her hand to him
frankly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But don’t tell anybody,’ says she, in an
eager little whisper.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Tell! “Is thy servant——” But the
brother over there catching cold on the grass
with a book before him—he was with you,
I think.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, Jacky and I are chums!’ says she.
This seems to settle the question. It occurs
to Mr. Crosby that it would be rather nice
to be chums with Susan, and he vaguely
wonders if she would accept a chum who was
not one of the family. Is Dominick a chum?
But, then, he is one of the family. When
Susan has chums, does she trust them—have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>little secrets with them? If so, he
may clearly rise to the desired position in
time. He is conscious of a sense of exhilaration
as he tells himself that Susan once
regarded him as a thief, and that he is bound
by her to keep that regard a secret.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, there you are, Mr. Crosby!’ says
Carew, stopping in his discussion with Betty;
‘come here and sit down.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t sit on Betty, whatever you do,’
says Dominick from his place beside her on
the grass; ‘she’d be sure to resent it. She
takes after our own particular auntie in the
way of temper. Susan, my darling’—making
a grab at Susan’s ankle, which she has
learned from long practice to avoid—‘come
and sit down by me. No? Your brainpower
must be weak. Have a cigarette,
Mr. Crosby. You need not mind the girls.
It is all we can do to keep our “baccy” from
them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If I wanted your nasty “baccy,”’ says
Betty, ‘it isn’t likely you would be able to
keep it from me. Give Mr. Crosby a match.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>‘Thanks, I have one,’ says Crosby. He
had accepted Dom’s offer of a cigarette
without hesitation, and, indeed, would have
smoked it to the bitter end rather than
offend any member of the little group around
him. They all please him; they all seem
in unison with him—frank, happy, rollicking
youngsters, without a scrap of real harm
amongst them. Perhaps the secret of their
success with Crosby lies in the fact that, in
spite of his being well in the thirties, he is
still a boy himself at heart, with a spice of
mischief in him not to be controlled. The
cigarette, however, proves very tolerable,
and Susan having seated herself where he
can distinctly see her, he feels that he is
going to spend an uncommonly pleasant
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s a shame to say Betty’s got a temper,’
says Susan. ‘I’m sure she hasn’t—not a
bad one, any way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You needn’t defend me, Susan,’ says
Betty, clasping her long, lean arms behind
her head. ‘I prefer to do it for myself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>and’—with a fell glance at the doomed
Dominick—‘I think I know where revenge
lies.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I give in!’ cries Mr. Fitzgerald frantically.
‘Betty, pax!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Never,’ says Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you burn my fly-book a second time,
I warn you that there will be murder,’ says
Dom; and then Betty has mercy.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A public retractation, then!’ demands she
viciously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A hundred of them. I swear to you,
Mr. Crosby, that I wronged her, and that
her temper is like that of an angel, and not
a bit like our Aunt Jeremiah’s’—softly, ‘May
I be forgiven!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Did you hear her in church?’ asks Carew,
turning to Crosby. ‘Aunt Jemima, I mean,
not Betty. She was mad with Sarah this
morning——’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby looks rather helplessly round him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Another sister?’ asks he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no,’ says Susan, whilst the others
explode; and Crosby, unable to resist their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>gaiety, joins in the merriment. ‘A servant——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Had a magenta feather in her hat!’ cries
Betty, roaring with laughter, ‘and Aunt
Jemima hates feathers, and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘This is my story, Betty,’ interrupts
Carew; ‘I insist on telling it. When the
Paradise hymn began, Aunt Jemima saw
the feather——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Pounced upon Sarah!’ cries Susan, who
is nearly in hysterics. ‘Oh, did you see
her? She sang the most dreadful things
at her until the poor girl nearly fainted,
and——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And then our only auntie punched her
in the back with her Prayer-book,’ puts in
Dom. ‘Really, Betty, I did wrong you!
You aren’t in it with her. She cussed and
swore like anything, but worse than all,
Susan, was her ribald rendering of music-hall
songs within the sainted precincts of the
church.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense, Dom! you spoil the story by
exaggeration.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>‘Exaggeration! My dear girl, didn’t you
hear her? Why, she was shouting it! She
got rather mixed up in the music—I’m bound
to say the two times are not the same—but
she managed it wonderfully. You heard
her, Carew, didn’t you?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘“Where did you get that hat?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>I waited for the rest, but I suppose her
courage failed her, or else the organ drowned
it; at all events, the second line,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘“Where did you get that tile?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>did not come in. But I think we ought to
speak to our auntie, Susan, don’t you? That
sort of thing is very well outside, but in a
church! Betty, you look as if you’d love to
speak to somebody. We’ll put you on for
this job. You shall expostulate with Aunt
Jemima on her deplorable weakness for low-class
comic songs.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall leave you to interview her on the
subject,’ says Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Interview! What a splendid word!’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Dom. ‘What’ll you sell it for?’ But Betty
very properly decides on not hearing him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Softly, sweetly, the sun is going down,
topping the distant hills, and now falling
behind them. A golden colour is lighting
all around. Overhead the swallows are
darting here and there, and from the beds
of mignonette in the old-fashioned garden
exquisite perfumes are wafted; and now ‘at
shut of evening flowers’ faint breezes rise,
and corners grow rich in shadows, and from
the stream below comes a song that makes
musical the happy hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby, with a sigh of distinct regret,
rises to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I fear I must go,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What, not so soon?’ cries Carew, getting
up too. Indeed, as Crosby persists, though
evidently with reluctance, in his determination
to leave them, they all get up, the
innate courtesy of this noisy group being
their best point.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Have another cigarette for the walk
home?’ says Dom hospitably.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>‘We’ll all go with you to the gate!’ cries
Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose a big traveller like you doesn’t
play tennis?’ says Carew diffidently, but
with an essence of hope in his tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, don’t I!’ says Crosby; ‘I’m quite a
dab at it, I can tell you! If I were to come
down to-morrow afternoon, would there be
any chance that any of you would be here
to play a game with me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>He looks at Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We’ll all be here!’ cries Betty ecstatically.
To have a new element thrown into their
daily games seems too enchanting for anything.
‘You will come?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘May I?’ says Crosby. Susan has not
answered, and now he purposely addresses
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I hope you will!’ says she cordially.
She had been thinking hurriedly if it would
be possible to ask him to luncheon—to their
early dinner. But with the children and
Jane’s attendance! Oh no—a thousand
times no! Yet it seems so inhospitable.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>‘Thank you, I should very much like to
come. It is quite taking pity on an unfortunate
bachelor,’ says he. And this being
settled, they all in a body prepare to accompany
him to the gate. Even little Tom runs
up to them, and Bonnie, with uneven steps,
hurries as fast as the poor mite can. Susan
turns to help him, and Crosby, watching her
for a moment, follows her, and, taking the
child in his arms, without a word swings
him to his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the gate, having bidden them good-bye,
and Dom having taken Bonnie on his
back for a race home, Crosby looks at Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you fond of cherries?’ asks he. His
face is profoundly grave, but she can see the
twinkle in his eyes, and her own give him
back a reproachful glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>This playing with fire is hardly prudent.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Sometimes,’ says she demurely.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And you, Bonnie?’ asks Crosby, pinching
gently the child’s pale pretty cheek as he
rests on Dominick’s back. ‘You like them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>I’m sure. Well, I’ll send you some to-morrow
and every day while they last, and
perhaps the red of their cheeks will run into
yours. See that it does, now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The child laughs shyly, and Crosby turns
to Susan again.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-bye, Miss Barry.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, don’t call her that!’ cries Betty.
‘That makes her sound like Aunt Jemima.
Susan, tell him he can call you by your own
name.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This handsome advice ought, thinks
Crosby, to fill Susan with angry confusion.
But it doesn’t.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You may—you may indeed!’ says she,
quite sweetly and naturally, looking him fair
in the eyes. ‘I should like you to call me
Susan, and I am very much obliged to you
for promising the cherries to Bonnie.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She gives him her hand; he presses it,
and goes up the road towards his home. A
little thorn in his heart goes with him. If
he had been her own age, would she so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>readily have permitted him to call her
Susan? No doubt she regards him as quite
a middle-aged old fellow, and truly, next to
her youth, that promises to be eternal, he
is nothing less.</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Fear oftentimes restraineth words,</div>
      <div class='line'>But makes not thoughts to cease.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The weather since the beginning of the
summer has been exceptionally warm, and
to-day has outdone itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here in the Cottage garden, surrounded by
its ivied walls, the heat is excessive, and
there is a certain languor in the lithe figure
of the girl as she comes forward, the dog
beside her, to greet Wyndham, that meets
his eye. Perhaps nervousness has conduced
to the pallor that is whitening her lips and
brow, and is making even more striking the
darkness of her appealing eyes. There is
something about her so full of grief suppressed
that he hastens to allay it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>‘I have come, you see,’ says he—he holds
out his hand, and she lays hers in it; he
holds it a moment—‘to speak about our
rent.’ He smiles at her. The smile, to tell
the truth, is a little grim, and hardly reassures
her. ‘I have come to the conclusion
that, as you wish to become my tenant, you
must pay me a huge rent.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah! and I have been thinking,’ says she
very sadly, with the mournful air of one who
is giving up all that is worth having in this
world, ‘that I shall not be your tenant at all,
and shall never pay you any rent.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you mean to say,’ says Wyndham,
reading her like a book, but humouring her
mood, ‘that you’ve found another house more
suited to you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no, it isn’t that. There is no house I
shall ever like so well as this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then, let me tell you beforehand that I
shall charge you a very handsome rent,’ persists
Wyndham, trying to be genial. He
smiles at her, but the smile is a dismal
failure.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>‘I can’t accept your offer—I can’t indeed,’
says the girl, who, in spite of her protests,
has brightened considerably beneath his
apparent determination to let the Cottage to
her. ‘This is your own house. Your mother
gave it to you. Mrs. Denis has told me all
about it, and if you give it to me you will
never come here again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall indeed—to collect my rent,’ says
Wyndham, a little touched by her evident
earnestness, and assuming a more natural air
of lightness.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, that,’ says she. She pauses a
moment, and then: ‘If’—timidly—‘you
would promise to come here sometimes to
see your dog and the flowers, I might think
of it.... I could keep out of your way
when you came. I could sit in my own
room, and you could——’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What a cheerful prospect for you!’ says
he. ‘I’m not a very agreeable fellow, I
know, when all is told; but I believe I am
so far on the road to respectability as to be
incapable of enjoying myself at the expense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of another fellow-creature’s comfort. Fancy
my taking the joys of the country with the
knowledge that you were stifling in some
cellar downstairs with a view to saving me
from the annoyance of your presence!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It wouldn’t be a cellar, and it isn’t downstairs,’
says the girl anxiously. ‘It is a
pretty little room upstairs.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s all the same,’ says Wyndham. ‘The
prettiest little room in the world is a bore if
one is imprisoned in it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Silence follows upon this. Wyndham,
going forward, stoops down to a bed of
seedlings that he had ordered to be planted
a month ago. They are in a very promising
condition, and the regret he feels for this
little home of his that is slipping through his
fingers increases. And yet to thrust her out—he
knows quite well now that he will never
do that.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Wyndham,’ says the girl—she is at
his elbow now—‘don’t be so sorry about it;
I shall go—to-morrow, if possible.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He is not prepared for this, nor for the soft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>breathings of her voice in his ear. He turns
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘All that is arranged,’ says he peremptorily.
‘You cannot go; you have nowhere
to go to, as’—pointedly—‘you tell me. In
the meantime, it is absolutely necessary that
you should have someone to live with you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is Mrs. Denis,’ says she nervously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not good enough for an heiress like you,’
returns he, smiling. Now that he has finally,
most unwillingly and most ungraciously, given
in to the fact that she is to be his tenant, he
feels more kindly towards her, and more
human. ‘You will want a lady companion
to read with you—you say you wish to go on
with your studies—and to go out with you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Go out!’ She regards him with quick
horror. ‘I shall never go out of this—never!’
cries she.</p>

<p class='c004'>The extraordinary passion of her manner
checks him. She has sunk upon a garden-chair,
as if incapable of supporting herself
any longer; and from this she looks up at
him with a sad and frightened face.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>‘I will leave,’ says she at last. It is a
most mournful surrender of hope, and all
things that make life still dear to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is no necessity for that,’ says
Wyndham hurriedly. ‘If I knew more—if
I knew how to help you—but’—breaking
off abruptly—‘you yourself have decided
against that. You must pardon me. You
have already told me that you do not wish
to tell me of yourself, your past——’</p>

<p class='c004'>She makes a little gesture with her hand.
Wyndham, standing still upon the gravelled
path, looks at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have been thinking about that,’ says she,
‘and’—with growing agitation—‘it has
seemed very ungrateful of me to distrust
you—you who have done so much for me,
who are now giving up your lovely home for
me. Mr. Wyndham’—rising and coming
towards him—‘I have made up my mind; I
will tell you all.’</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
